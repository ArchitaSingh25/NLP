a governor ended in 2011 13 complaint had been filed against mr perdue with the state ethic commission which on two occasion ruled that the governor had violated state ethic law the commission took the unusual step of fining mr perdue while he wa governor there were numerous other question including some about the role of mr perdue personal lawyer also state legislator in pushing bill through the legislature that included special provision that gave mr perdue 100 000 in state tax relief and when his tenure a governor wa coming to close mr perdue met with georgia official who oversee the state port to discus use of terminal for family business according to document obtained by the atlanta soon after he left office in fact he opened new company that specialized in exporting product through savannah when you are public official you are supposed to be acting entirely on behalf of the public and not for said yasha heidari former senior legal counsel to the state ethic commission looking at his record a both an attorney and citizen of the state had serious concern in written statement spokeswoman for mr perdue rejected that assessment saying that the frequent criticism he faced while governor wa largely politically motivated there hadn been republican governor in georgia for 135 year the statement said governor perdue wa the david who slew the democrat goliath during the wait for mr perdue confirmation hearing some in the farming industry have come to his defense don think you are going to find man any more honorable than sonny perdue said zippy duvall georgia

perdue played college football a at the university of georgia and later worked briefly a practicing veterinarian he rose through the rank of the state legislature and in the late 1990s switched his party affiliation from democrat to republican because he said the state party had lost it focus on family value one of mr perdue first act after he wa sworn in a governor in january 2003 wa to sign an executive order establishing new code of ethic for executive branch employee the order which applied to the governor himself prohibited state employee from using their power for any financial or other personal benefit and barred them from taking any gift worth more than 25 in carrying out their official duty and obligation all officer and employee of state government must work solely for the public good striving vigilantly to avoid even the appearance that their action are motivated by private or personal interest the 2003 executive order said but mr perdue ended up collecting at least 25 000 worth of benefit or gift during his year a governor state record show the gift ranged from ticket to nascar race and football game to flight paid for by altria the tobacco company and by csx the railroad giant according to 2010 report by citizen for responsibility and ethic in washington liberal nonprofit group mr perdue spokeswoman in the written statement said that none of these gift violated the ban because the trip were for official state business and were perfectly acceptable a saving taxpayer fund the gift were to the state the statement read not to the governor the fine by the state ethic commission in 2005 came after the commission concluded that mr perdue had failed to properly report the use of an airplane owned by one of his family business for trip the commission also found that he had taken campaign contribution in amount that exceeded state limit from several donor including political action committee run by suntrust the bank mr perdue called the violation technical and the investigation politically motivated teddy lee the executive secretary of the state ethic commission wa fired from his job in january 2006 and in an interview he blamed mr perdue for his firing mr lee had served in the job under four governor this looked like political hit to me mr lee said mr lee dismissal came a mr perdue wa seeking and just month before his largest scandal emerged over 100 000 state tax break he received thanks to legislative maneuver engineered by lawmaker who wa also his personal lawyer the focus of the controversy wa piece of property in florida that mr perdue purchased in 2004 the purchase allowed him to defer paying federal capital gain tax on separate piece of georgia land which he had previously sold at profit when that transaction wa completed mr perdue still owed georgia about 100 000 in state tax then mr perdue signed bill the following year eliminating that state tax obligation a state law wa changed to allow rollover relief on capital gain even if the new property being purchased wa out of state during deliberation on the legislation larry neal member of the georgia house of representative who also worked part time a personal lawyer for mr perdue intervened to make the change in that provision retroactive that meant it would cover mr perdue 2004 land deal saving the governor 100 000 the reported at the time mr perdue spokeswoman said the change in state law wa not intended to benefit mr perdue it benefited all georgian the statement said scott faber of the environmental working group nonprofit organization that keep close watch on policy at the agriculture department said he had question about mr perdue fitness to take over the department given his record of and conflict of interest a governor of georgia it is fair to ask if he is fit to run federal agency mr faber said but mr duvall of the american farm bureau federation belief the opposite mr duvall said that a former farmer mr perdue is just what the nation need to run the department he ha worked on farm and owned business that buy and sell grain domestically and internationally mr duvall said it ought to be requirement that someone

              " 'houston venezuela had plan it wa tactical approach designed specifically to take lionel messi and the other dangerous argentine attacker out of the game by applying forward pressure and forcing argentina to make long hopeful pass and it worked for about seven minute but in the eighth minute messi conjured the kind of technical genius that compels most observer to call him the best soccer player in the world artfully lifting perfect pas about 15 yard in to gonzalo higuaín with one striking touch higuaín converted it into goal the first in argentina victory on saturday in copa américa centenario quarterfinal in that decisive moment like so many others experienced by opponent hoping to stop messi all of venezuela carefully conceived defensive tactic were laid to waste they have that stroke of genius that change all your scheme venezuela coach rafael dudamel said they had an incredible pas from messi and they scored messi ha frequently had brilliant stroke like that one and now it is the united state turn to try to find way to suppress them the united state earned spot in tuesday copa américa semifinal here at nrg stadium by beating ecuador but the dubious prize awaiting them is messi argentina mesmerizing dribbling passing and shooting virtuoso this is special united state coach jurgen klinsmann said absolutely it special to play against these type of player when you get the opportunity to play against one of the biggest player in the world you want to raise your game you want to enjoy it the united state ha had few chance to play meaningful game against star of messi caliber who also played on such quality team fifa ha argentina ranked no 1 in the world tuesday match will be the rough equivalent of taking on pelé brazil in 1970 or ferenc puskas hungary in 1954 or the team led by that other argentine soccer genius diego maradona in 1986 a klinsmann noted the united state wa second from beating portugal at the 2014 world cup until cristiano ronaldo who ha at time been considered messi equal provided gorgeous cross that enabled portugal to tie the game over the year the united state ha faced the like of england wayne rooney at the 2010 world cup brazil ronaldinho at the 1999 confederation cup and italy paolo maldini one of the best left back in history at the 1990 world cup a well a brazil duo of bebeto and romário and romania gheorghe hagi some of the top player of their era at the 1994 world cup at the 1934 world cup the united state lost by to italy and one of the goal wa scored by giuseppe meazza whom some historian consider the best player italy ha produced at the 1998 world cup klinsmann scored against the united state toward the end of his prolific career a one of the most dangerous attacker for the world champion west germany and germany but in recent memory there is nothing that quite resembles tuesday challenge two year ago ronaldo did not enjoy the kind of team support from portugal that messi doe now with javier mascherano ángel di maría when healthy sergio agüero and particularly higuaín argentina penetrating no 9 who scored twice against venezuela spend too much time focusing on either messi or higuaín and the other could act decisively we have two striker who are really exceptional gerardo martino argentina coach said after saturday match cannot repeat it enough really feel this people in argentina have hard time accepting the quality of soccer player that we have we have two no 9 and we proceed with what we feel is best martino watched venezuela hack down messi several time in the quarterfinal game and said the united state would certainly use every possible mean to stop him just hope that every possible way is legal way he said at news conference monday a superb a messi is some believe that he will not have achieved his true potential until he win major trophy for argentina just a he ha numerous time for the club team barcelona but after tying gabriel batistuta record of 54 international goal for argentina on saturday messi said he felt no pressure m always going to be in there messi said m very calm in maradona time argentina also had strong supporting player like claudio caniggia jorge valdano jorge burruchaga and later batistuta but like messi maradona wa the team clear supremo when the united state beat argentina at the 1995 copa américa maradona wa no longer playing for his country but klinsmann had the chance to play against maradona several time in the 1990 world cup west germany beat maradona argentina in dismal final in rome you are talking about two wonderful player the best in the world in their time klinsmann said referring to maradona and messi it now messi time and when had the opportunity to play many game against maradona it wa maradona time we all admire these player but there are also way to stop them am not the type of person who pull out old story and tell the player how we did it that not me but there are way to play against these wonderful player klinsmann showed his team video scouting report of messi and argentina and said his player needed to give 10 to 15 percent more in order to achieve an upset tuesday but the argentine are not infallible he added they have not won major tournament in over 20 year and messi team ha come up short twice in the last two year germany beat la albiceleste a argentina is known in the final of the 2014 world cup and chile won in the final of last year copa américa both time it took champion to beat messi and argentina you guy are probably worrying more about messi than we are the united state captain michael bradley told reporter very good player that also probably an understatement it still soccer game with 11 of their guy against 11 of our guy',\n",

and his apparent endorsement of racial profiling drew admonishment even from member of his party it really one thing to have one party behind you mr lepage said on the radio in an interview that wa at time uncharacteristically it another thing not to have any party behind you but in the early afternoon in twitter message mr lepage seemed to have regained his spirit of defiance regarding rumor of resignation to paraphrase mark twain the report of my political demise are greatly exaggerated the message read mr lepage wa spending much of the day in the town of baileyville 170 mile from here near the canadian border by nighttime it wa clear there wa basis for the governor renewed swagger a house republican leader said they would not join the call to convene special session which would have raised the possibility of impeachment we believe that the governor is addressing this issue said state representative kenneth fredette an ally of mr lepage and the minority leader of the house we are not interested in coming back in special session speaking with reporter after the caucus meeting mr fredette condemned mr lepage remark no one agrees with what the governor said or did he said and asserted that no one get free pas but he then seemed to give one to mr lepage saying that special session would distract voter from important issue ahead of the fall election since he wa elected in 2010 and in 2014 mr lepage ha had at least nine political life and been able to ride out wave of controversy often provoked by his harsh insulting and racially charged statement the outburst have angered democrat and embarrassed moderate republican yet left largely unruffled political base drawn to the former businessman unfiltered style democrat and some senate republican raised the possibility of special session to consider way to rebuke the governor but such session could be held only with the approval of half of both caucus in each legislative chamber the house republican caucus held the line after meeting at 6 m the caucus meeting followed day of controversy after mr lepage stated at meeting last wednesday that the vast majority of heroin dealer in maine were black and hispanic a criticism swelled mr lepage came to believe that democratic lawmaker drew gattine had called him racist and left him threatening voice mail threaded with obscenity which he followed by suggesting that he and mr gattine have duel on friday mr lepage reiterated his comment about drug and race showing reporter binder of people arrested on drug charge and asserting that black and hispanic people from out of state were the enemy those comment led amy volk republican in the senate to make public break with mr lepage questioning his sanity and sobriety in facebook post although she later apologized for doing so she called for special legislative session to consider censure of mr lepage it just so nonproductive m volk said in an interview on tuesday and so offensive to citizen of color that they would be somehow lumped in with people that are breaking the law just because of the color of their skin democratic leader said they would continue to call for the governor resignation what the house republican have done is slammed the door on their willingness to actually address this behavior at this time said jeff mccabe the democratic majority leader of the house on tuesday night we think that we can work with senate republican a well a some house republican who we know are not happy with tonight display of political theater mr lepage met with republican legislative leader on monday when he wa urged to take step like apologizing directly to the lawmaker he had threatened and wa asked to seek help professional or otherwise according to person briefed on the discussion during his interview on the radio station wvom mr lepage said he just can do some of the senate republican demand although he did not specify which one he added that republican lawmaker in the house want to salvage what we can and move forward he went on to say that he wa looking at option conceding that his remark had cost him crucial support if ve lost my ability to convince the maine people that what we need and that the type of people we need in augusta then you know maybe it is time to move on he said his later twitter message ridiculed any talk of his stepping down on the radio he also apologized for his behavior toward mr gattine calling it totally totally unnecessary although in an interview with local television that afternoon he suggested that mr gattine owed an apology to him in the morning radio interview he also defended his comment on drug and race saying linking the two were fact and adding all life matter every drug arrest we get the story and the people and when it come to meth lab they re essentially all maine white people mr lepage said when it come to the heroin epidemic it just the opposite the imbroglio seems to have strengthened some republican commitment to mr lepage in some part of the state in lewiston on monday night bartender and patron when they realized they both still supported the governor but it ha left those who associate more strongly with the state tradition of moderate republican like senator susan collins or margaret chase smith trying to explain his action it seems to be the norm now to speak what on your mind now without filter said wendy ault former republican state representative and member of the early college task force appointed by mr lepage adding believe in civilized discourse',\n",

disturbing sign that digital 9 11 terror attack is being readied for election day in the u to ensure that donald trump doe not win such an attack involving widespread internet and power outage would have nothing to do with russia or any other foreign state it would be furnished by agency of the u deep state in classic false flag covert manner but the resulting chaos and assault on american democracy will be conveniently blamed on russia that present double benefit russia would be further demonized a foreign aggressor justifying even harsher counter measure by america and it european ally against moscow secondly digital attack on america presidential election day this week would allow the washington establishment to pronounce the result invalidate due to russian cyber subversion that option stand to be invoked if the ballot result showed republican candidate donald trump a the imminent victor democrat rival hillary clinton is the clear choice for the white house among the washington establishment she ha the backing of wall street finance capital the corporate medium the military industrial complex and the deep state agency of the pentagon and cia the fix ha been in for month to get her elected by the power that be owing to her well groomed obedience to american imperialist interest the billionaire property magnate trump is too much of maverick to be entrusted with the white house a far a the american ruling elite are concerned the trouble is however that despite the massive campaign to discredit trump his poll support remains stubbornly close to clinton the latter ha been tainted with too many scandal involving allegation of sleazy dealing with wall street so called pay for play favor while she wa former secretary of state and her penchant for inciting overseas war for regime change using jihadist terrorist foot soldier a one headline from mcclatchy news only day ago put it majority of voter think clinton acted illegally new poll find trump is right the u presidential election is rigged despite handwringing condemnation by pundit it seems obvious that the system is heavily stacked against any candidate who doe not conform with the interest of the establishment the massive medium orchestrated campaign against trump is testimony to that but such is popular disgust with clinton her sleaze ball husband bill and the washington establishment that her victory is far from certain indeed in the last week before voting this tuesday various poll are showing neck and neck race with even some indicator putting the republican narrowly ahead over the weekend the washington post which ha been one of the main medium outlet panning trump on daily basis reported this the electoral map is definitely moving in trump direction this is where possible deep state contingency plan is being readied to scupper shock win by trump in recent day american medium are reporting virtual state of emergency by the u government and it security agency to thwart what they claim are russian effort to incite election day cyber mayhem in one exclusive report by the nbc network on november 3 it wa claimed that the u government belief hacker from russia or elsewhere may try to undermine next week presidential election and is mounting an unprecedented effort to counter their cyber meddling on november 4 the washington post reported intelligence official warn of russian mischief in election and beyond apparently the emergency security response is being coordinated by the white house the department of homeland security the cia the national security agency and other element of the defense department according to nbc these claim of russian state hacker interfering in the u political system are not new last month the obama administration officially accused moscow of this alleged malfeasance russian president vladimir putin ha lambasted american claim that his country is seeking to disrupt the presidential election a hysterical nonsense aimed at distracting the electorate from far more deep rooted internal problem the obama administration and it state security agency have not provided one iota of evidence to support their allegation against russia nevertheless the repeated charge have tendency to stick julian assange wikileaks founder the clinton campaign ha for month been accusing trump of being pro russian stooge her campaign ha also claimed that russian hacker have colluded with the whistleblower organization wikileaks to release thousand of private email damaging clinton with the intention of swaying the election in favor of trump wikileaks director julian assange and the russian government have both rejected any suggestion that they are somehow collaborating or that they are working to get trump elected but on the eve of the election the u authority are recklessly pushing hysteria that russia is trying to subvert american democracy michael mcfaul the former u ambassador to russia from 2012 to 2014 is quoted a saying the russian are in an offensive mode and the u is working on strategy to respond to that and at the highest level nbc cite senior obama administration official a saying that the russian want to sow a much confusion a possible and undermine our process ominously the news outlet add that step are being taken to prepare for worst case scenario including cyber attack that shuts down part of the power grid or the internet nearly two week ago on october 21 22 the u wa hit with widespread internet outage the actor behind the distributed denial of service were not identified but the disruption wa nationwide and it temporarily disabled many popular consumer service one former official at the u department of homeland security described the event a having all the sign of what would be considered drill could that cyber attack have been the work of u deep state agency a dress rehearsal for an even bigger outage planned for november 8 election day the washington establishment want clinton over trump she the marionette of choice for their strategic interest including more hostile foreign policy towards russia in syria ukraine and elsewhere but trump might just snatch an election day victory from the jaw of defeat george soros ngo manipulator in which case the shadowy force that really rule america will trigger digital 9 11 it not difficult to imagine the chaos and mayhem from internet blackout power transport banking and communication paralysis even for just temporary period of few hour month of fingering russia a destabilizing foreign enemy intent on interfering in u democracy to get comrade trump into the white house would then serve a self fulfilling prophecy in that event the u authority could plausibly move to declare the election of donald trump null and void in fact the scenario could be contrived to far more serious level than merely suspending the election result the u authority could easily feign that state of emergency is necessary in order to defend national security that contingency catapult beyond rigged politics it is green light for coup état by the deep state force who found that they could not win through the normal rigging method',\n",
              " 'taming the corporate medium beast whatever the outcome on november 8th the u will be on collision course with china regardless of who is elected next president the attention of the u will shift to asia originally appeared at strategic culture foundation when it come to the authenticity of the american electoral process one must start with the medium eighty percent of it openly side against trump and favor hillary clinton predetermining the outco me of the election with omitted or worse distorted and ignored news deliberately avoiding any irreparable damage to clinton the endless wikileaks revelation about the collusion between the democrat and the medium establishment clearly show that there is very specific plan to prevent trump victory the lack of impartiality give citizen little information to make final choice in term of voting openly favoring the democratic candidate therefore it is more than fair to say that with this medium situation and the number of poll in favor of the democratic candidate that it is difficult to imagine different outcome other than the most obvious one it is also true that there are some factor in favor of trump often his voter like to stay silent instead of exposing themselves in spurious survey used to manipulate the electoral vote however this election will see the triumph of candidate that will be able to attract new voter to the poll in this sense the many who say they are pro clinton may stay home on november 8 completely disheartened by the numerous scandal of the democratic candidate in spite of the medium censorship striking difference between the two presidential campaign regard the energy of the supporter trump base is alive and breathes an air of revolution while that of the clinton is trying hard to stay alive this is factor that could be decisive if the margin are reduced or proven false on these base it would already be enough to fully describe the u electoral system a being corrupt to the core the medium bias covert funding of the clinton foundation wikileaks and hacking against the democratic national committee dnc are all cause that certify how the so called deep state is clearly supportive of clinton that said hillary clinton remains the favorite candidate to win this election with enormous percentage around 92 if one listens to the new york time also forgetting for moment the outcome whatever it is this election will deliver the most unpopular president in recent american history with all the attendant consequence ha there been anyone more unpopular than either candidate over the 18 month or so of the election campaign but perhaps more interesting to ask is once elected what kind of president would hillary clinton be the most obvious answer is that she will be belligerent president ready to impose her vision of the world with it accompanying sound of war and bomb and yet the more we delve into the issue the more we realize that perhaps such description is too generic and imprecise clinton first of all is above all president in the hand of her donor and rarely can u president independently fashion foreign policy strategy obama famous interview with goldberg in the atlantic provides striking example where he described how he would have liked his foreign policy doctrine to be le involved around the world instead seeing increased use of soft power to obtain geopolitical advance obama during his presidency wa much more in favor of attempt to expand u influence with proxy like in ukraine with the use of neo nazi battalion or with the use of terrorist in syria a opposed to using american ground troop scenario that is impractical for many reason also for these decision he is considered to be weak president with little knowledge or interest in foreign policy obama is not pacifist god forbid but it is true that he ha often been softly opposed to direct confrontation with russia and iran in different situation in the course of his presidency returning to clinton who are her master first of all are the regional ally of the united state in the middle east saudi arabia and qatar thanks to million of dollar of generous donation that will grant them the ability to demand concession in specific situation regarding the middle east secondly and most importantly there is the american elite who have strong interest in maintaining the u role in the world and prolonging it unipolar moment it is principally for this reason that clinton probably will be nothing more than copy of obama in term of foreign policy but with many more concession to regional ally in the middle east and generic more aggressive policy towards russia china and iran it is vision certainly closer to that of the neoconservative but in term of specific her foreign policy decision will be operated mostly by her master that just want to get richer clinton presidency will likely continue with fairly similar foreign policy doctrine to that of obama in europe and the middle east but with some important difference in asia it is likely that her donor especially riyadh and doha will try to influence her decision allowing them to have freehand in syria in ukraine it is even more improbable that clinton would try to reverse the negative trend for kiev in their ato since this would require an intervention of nato directly unleashing direct confrontation between the atlantic alliance and the russian federation something that would escalate into situation that would favor no one the most obvious reason why the clinton presidency is unlikely to deviate much from the course of the obama presidency is the nature of the two major conflict in syria damascus ha now begun the victory phase and there is no room for armed intervention by regional country thanks to the russian and iranian veto a usual in the middle east it is just hysteria from washington regardless of who will be the next president in ukraine the situation is frozen in term of territorial advance it is unlikely that would change without massive boost of ukrainian troop to the east but the effectiveness of such wa seen in the 2014 war moreover moscow ha suggested that they clearly posse all the ability to withstand such attack helping the donbas and worsening the condition for the ukrainian nation the war is played in the courtyard of moscow thousand of kilometer away from the united state clear strategic disadvantage unbridgeable by washington even in the case of ukraine it come down to anti russian hysteria at little cost thanks to medium propaganda even european country are starting to complain about the sanction against moscow not to mention the prospect of escalation by nato in ukraine in addition to not being able to win the war new war in the east of ukraine would become the perfect cause for existential crisis for atlantic alliance this is risk that washington is well aware of and weighing the strategic value of ukraine which is zero when compared to that of europe the middle east and southeast asia it is easy to see why the next u president would still not be willing to have conventional let alone nuclear confrontation with moscow over ukraine unfortunately the question change dramatically when we take into account an area of greatest strategic interest to the u elite such a southeast asia clinton always promoted the pivot to asia arguing that the only way to counter the rise of china is by in every way seeking to contain the asian power in this sense we can also notice her effort a secretary of state in the clinton reset policy that sought to bring moscow and washington closer together and strategy that could have helped the united state in containing with moscow help the chinese giant fast forward seven year later and the result are disaster the u and russia have never been so divided american pressure and aggression toward moscow in georgia and ukraine have ended up pushing the former soviet country into the arm of the asian giant power effectively creating counterweight to the u failure that ha worsened with iran joining the eurasian club thanks to continued destabilization from saudi arabia qatar israel turkey and the united state in area ranging from north africa to the persian gulf and passing through the middle east with the consolidation of this anti hegemonic bloc the u ha lost most of it option to take action in an area of keen interest such a the middle east the russian presence in europe especially in the context of ukraine is an insurmountable obstacle in the middle east russo iranian cooperation ha averted possible use of foreign troop in syria the final decision of the united state not to intervene in such scenario is also based on vague hope that iran will eventually gravitate toward the western sphere of influence and away from this anti hegemonic bloc to that effect the nuclear deal make more sense especially considering the openness of western politician to the rouhani administration when compared to the preceding ahmadinejad one even towards russia there is the continuing hope that u power center will be able to stretch the tentacle of colored democracy by 2018 russian presidential election imposing candidate with markedly more western view good luck with that one a putin ha about an 80 approval rating dashing uncle sam dream russia and iran continue to dominate their region of influence expanding contact and alliance without giving any sign of bending to the opposing policy of washington the foreign policy of washington in europe and in the middle east especially in the last eight year ha been schizophrenic ineffective and against american interest in region in the first place in southeast asia the situation is quite different with the rise of china in term of gdp military investment that is higher than the allocated budget and the number of military personnel available and if the growth of the last 15 year continues on it trajectory for further 10 year then china will certainly become the number one world super power it is situation that directly threatens american hegemony something that ha not happened in decade for these reason clinton came up with what is now known a the pivot away from europe and towards asia a well a reset with russia in the hope of lengthening the list of country hostile to beijing with the aim of containing china fast forward again to several year later and a already stressed the effect ha been quite the opposite economically china is continuing to grow and is consolidating it economical power with new institution like the aiib and the brics bank creating an alternative pole to the american globalist system of imf world bank fed militarily there are le and le nation willing to patrol the south and east china sea with the united state japan and australia rather country like the philippine and vietnam are seeking dialogue with the chinese giant hoping to improve their economic partnership for it part the u will not miss chance to provoke beijing with reckless military maneuver it is easy to see that with clinton presidency the u when compared to europe or the middle east will be more likely to pursue aggressive strategy in southeast asia with much greater determination a to risk conflict the major u national donor composed entirely by the globalist elite control the press bank insurance the military industrial complex big pharma the rating agency and central bank and in addition to increasing their earnings have every intention to extending the unipolar moment of the united state and ensuring that no superpower can emerge to be peer competitor the rise of china is no go seen in perspective at present and in the past it ha certainly been the perfect client to allow the turbo capitalist u system to outsource cheap labor accelerating globalization to enrich the pocket of these privileged super wealthy the problem for the u elite is the rise a time go by of the chinese elite that ha every intention of not being subject to the will of washington at state level we can perceive this struggle with the emergence of institution like the aiib and organization of the brics clinton obeying her master donor will obviously try to accentuate the influence of the u on regional ally in asia to inflame anti chinese sentiment the strategy is clear to prevent beijing from dominating the region the risk of conflict even while being the highest of any other area of the world is unlikely to happen in the immediate future especially due to china restrained approach more likely expect an asymmetric response by beijing aided by it finance the most likely hypothesis regard an involvement of the chinese military in the middle east to fight terrorism perhaps with an iranian and russian partnership thanks to organization such a sco the alliance interest organization and international framework are all ready the only thing missing being direct order from beijing this posture and threat also serf a deterrent to washington meddling in asia acting a kind of counter asymmetrical balance it is not far fetched to see in future presidency of clinton chinese troop alongside those of russia iran syria iraq and maybe even egypt in the middle east fighting against state sponsored terrorism in scenario of this kind with all the behind the scene negotiation between ankara tehran tel aviv and moscow it is difficult to imagine regional war but rather the increasing isolation of saudi arabia and qatar thanks to the policy of the anti hegemonic bloc in the middle east beijing which always play on different table and well in advance ha already approached riyadh in the recent past it largest world supplier with proposal and attractive agreement just a it did with britain immediately before the brexit vote trying to bring the city of london and it influential financial market into the orbit of china for now the saudi family remains loyal u ally and wall street finance but with new supranational circuit a aiib let u say supported by financial market like london it is not unthinkable that a the final asymmetric move beijing could aspire to deal deadly blow to u hegemony by shifting oil trading from the dollar system to the new petro yuan this scenario is something that ha been talked about and that frightens the u elite more than anything else regardless of who is elected the next president the full attention of the u will shift mainly to the asian area prompting beijing to think about it future and how to deal with american containment so far rather than military deterrent it look like the economical factor will play huge role against an aggressive u military posture in the asian region',\n",

twitter november 2 2016 politics next tuesday is the american election and for better or for worse we ll pick the next president at that time assuming we don get mired in voter fraud and recount and we ll either brace for government mandated sjw enema or bask in temporary setback of those evil people but today want to talk on trump once to match an article from last week and intend to focus on how he is the american candidate a opposed to the special interest group one had conversation last week with some people who acted a sjws but were later presented by mutual friend a libertarian the discussion immediately went nasty with my opposition painting trump and anyone who supported him a racist and bigot upon trying to determine why two of the left ubiquitous label were applied to me this time learned that their perspective wa unless you were universally for all special interest group you were bigot or racist false dichotomy and the american nightmare the problem found out wa that these people have distilled the political spectrum down into black or white situation either you want all refugee here from the middle east all the hispanic from any country south of the border to come here freely and citizenship for those already here and that any black people shot by police are just misunderstood and were turning their life around or you re racist there simply no middle ground they don understand that trump is not special interest candidate by which mean that he is not going to put any minority group ahead of the rest of u at our expense but he is not racist towards minority or sexist towards woman it is possible to be against illegal immigration but treat american of hispanic ancestry a valued citizen whom you will represent it is possible to be against feminism affirmative action and the persecution of men for the profit of woman yet still value american woman a american themselves it is possible to note that some black people cause disproportionate amount of crime yet note that some police are racist and see that there are bad and good cop and bad and good black people the american dream is that all men are created equal and that men a in humanity not just male it is not that all men are equal and there a big difference to note here you have the same opportunity a everyone else when you are born with the exception of disability and do not know anyone myself included that is against governmental aid for the disabled what we have instead is the american nightmare where the left us government and tax for the most inane of cause trying to fix any disadvantaged group lot real or imagined so that thing will be better they take from the producer and give to the non producer so that according to their idealistic vision they will suddenly become productive member of society or become addicted to the welfare tit and vote democrat for the rest of their life the good of the country over that of the individual long gone are responsible democrat like kennedy who told u to ask what you can do for your country every recent democratic president from carter to obama and most of the democrat congressman view the working middle class of the country a simply group to exploit for their pet special interest group trump is the first candidate in long time who isn for the black or the gay or the muslim or the feminist or whatever and that matter lot the reason why not being for special interest group which is all that hillary is for with her youth vote black vote woman vote gay vote etc is so important is that these group even put together do not matter when it come down to the good of the country don get me wrong there plenty of good hardworking black people just like there the same for woman and for gay and for young people but these hardworking folk from all these group aren going to be part of the blm or la raza or lamda because they re too busy being productive american activism is for unemployed people what going to happen if we don placate blm and just ignore them they riot bit more and some get arrested what if we told them that people that commit crime to protest being treated like they commit lot of crime is as backwards thinking and counter productive to their goal they quit rioting what would happen if we shut the mexican border down to illegal immigration but made straightforward but strict path to citizenship for hispanic that wanted to be citizen what if we said this is america we appreciate your culture and encourage to preserve it and your language in your child but the national language is english and all business and schooling will be done in it and in it only and it your choice to not learn it but the difficulty that will arise from that choice are all on you they be american proud of their heritage and their legal immigration and citizenship a well what would happen if we told gay people that it cool if they have civil union under the law and have the same right a everyone else but it not cool trying to pick fight with christian bakery to make the government hall monitor come drive them out of business just because their belief in their god and that you re sinning make you uneasy and worried that they might actually be right what if we told them it ok to do whatever you want with another consenting adult but you don have to try to make five year old decide if they re gay or straight when they shouldn be wondering about that till puberty hit they be normal american who just happen to like sex with the same gender and they quit pushing their agenda and being obnoxious and in the rest of our face what would happen if we talked to muslim and said that there is huge deafening silence when it come to the subject of islamic terrorism from them that make it hard to trust any of them what if we told them that we needed their help to bring the religion out of it tacit acceptance and support of terrorism and part of that help mean supporting u vetting muslim coming here more strictly until they are no longer statistically more likely to be terrorist than people of other religion and ethnicity they go along with that and maybe realize we re fixing problem not hating people what would happen if we told woman that feminism ha all but killed modern marriage due to universal punishment of divorced men and that no punishment for false rape accuser both make men not trust woman and insult any real rape survivor what would happen if we told them that giving them job for their genitalia over their skill is destroying industry by lowering the only standard that matter that of merit that of excellence what if we told them that gender ratio and quota may fix the macro view of sexism but make the man passed over for the position solely because you were female pissed a all hell towards woman and when you do that to the majority of men you ll be just a successful and just a hated by men a men were and were hated by you in year past they realize that it not competition it a cooperation and maybe skill should be valued over sex what would happen if we stopped all these divisive issue that really don do anything other than tear u apart and work on better economy on right for all on border security what would happen if we simply looked at each other a american and put u all of u first what would happen if we ripped out the crap in the federal government that overtaxes people or deploys armed force against our own countryman what would happen if we made the supreme court constitutional again and made term limit reality for congress maybe we could get government for by and of the people again maybe america can indeed by great again like the man say conclusion m not in special interest group no president outside of george bush right after the september 11th attack that can recall since my childhood ha been for me a an american ve always been someone to be taxed to be disarmed to be hated to be blamed it not racism or bigotry to want u all to be treated a equal and not be penalized for real and imagined wrong that occurred in the past before wa born or more recently yet with which had nothing to do m not part of the problem m an

unauthorized immigrant predicted very aggressive support for using the full power of the federal government to discourage this kind of interference these local politician take it upon themselves to allow people who have been here for long time to stay here and receive service mr stein said the trump administration is basically saying if you want to accommodate don expect the rest of u to pay for your service some believe mr trump could go further than simply pulling federal funding perhaps fighting such policy in court or even prosecuting city leader this is uncharted territory in some way to see if they re just playing chicken or see if they will relent said jessica vaughan the director of policy study at the center for immigration study which support reduced immigration city have gotten away with this for long time because the federal government ha never attempted to crack down on them m vaughan said the fight could also signal twist in the struggle over the power of the federal government a this time liberal city rather than conservative state resist what they see a federal intervention city may not have the power to give people right said muzaffar chishti the director of the migration policy institute office at the new york university school of law but they have lot of power of resistance and that what they re displaying right now no legal definition of sanctuary city exists and many mayor dislike the label saying it unfairly describes policy that merely stop local law enforcement from acting a immigration deputy generally the term refers to jurisdiction that have placed limit on when local law enforcement agency comply with federal request to hold undocumented immigrant for detention and turn them over to immigration and custom enforcement those request

of homeland security for checking against immigration database more than 500 county and city have some kind of policy limiting cooperation with the immigration authority according to an estimate from

arizona that allowed the police to question people they detained about immigration status that provision wa upheld by the supreme court rudolph giuliani an adviser to mr trump who is expected to join his administration unsuccessfully sued the government in 1996 when he wa the mayor of new york over federal law he said infringed on local protection for undocumented immigrant the latest clash will be most acutely felt in california home to an estimated 2 3 million of the country 11 million undocumented immigrant not only doe the state allow such immigrant to obtain driver license but it also offer them college tuition and allows them to hold professional license to work a lawyer architect and nurse state law passed in 2014 limit county cooperation with federal official the policy came

for antiterrorism program and community health center taking away funding because our law enforcement will not act a federal agent would not only be irresponsible but immoral mr garcetti said it would be an unprecedented overreach of federal executive power to take even more of our tax away mr de blasio in new york ha signaled that he will look for more way to fight widespread deportation and the city is directing undocumented immigrant to it free legal service new york ha the country largest municipal identification program and maintains database of nearly million people mr de blasio ha pledged not to give any information from the program to the federal government melissa keaney lawyer at the national immigration law center said the federal government could not compel state to carry out immigration enforcement anything that try to coerce local government is going to be challenged because these agency are only responsible for local arrest m keaney said their responsibility is for carrying out public safety criminal law and it is not within their responsibility or authority to act a federal agent how much city can fight off deportation however remains unclear legal expert say that city official cannot bar immigration agent and that it is unlikely that they could declare physical sanctuary on public property much of their resistance may lie in simply not cooperating rick su law professor at the university at buffalo who ha researched immigration and local government said that unless mr trump ratchet up the number and reach of federal immigration agent it is difficult to see how he can achieve the two to three million removal that he ha proposed without state and local assistance in identifying and detaining suspected unauthorized immigrant for now many city leader are focusing on calming undocumented immigrant frayed nerve jorge elorza the mayor of providence i and the son of undocumented guatemalan immigrant who were eventually naturalized stood behind lectern

              " 'welcome to the trump world order by maria dubovikova so donald trump is the new president of the united state allan lichtman and his 13 key to the white house have been proved right the 30 year tradition of predicting the out come of the u presidential election continues uninterrupted political figure have started checking their social medium account deleting tweet that could be uncomplimentary to trump it doesn help a the internet remembers everything some are even more unlucky french president francois hollande said in public recently that trump make you want to retch the global political narrative is quickly drifting away from the dumb trump to congratulation dear mr president always knew you would win journalist who had been vilifying trump and promising apocalypse in case he is elected have started debating how he would possibly save the world most expert failed in their prognosis they could not imagine that the erratic trump will be victorious over reserved pragmatic and experienced clinton they had their reason but in their analysis they missed lot of thing why trump is president elect trump is living example of the american dream from being simple middle class ameri can child of second generation german immigrant he jumped to become billionaire and then the u president his penthouse apartment is said to be more luxurious than the white house he had his own plane before becoming the u president more importantly he ha promised to revive the american dream for all american irrespec tive of their social status expert and the so called elite considered his mannerism and choice of language a disadvantage but instead it turned out to be his advantage a he connected to people in their language the fact remains that the elite and people considering themselves intellectual do not form the majority in any society the u is no different trump tweet and declaration were shocking for the elite but were very common for the mass his imperfection made him closer to the ordinary people especially from the working class the he is one of u image always work when you deal with the mass he gambled with it and emerged the winner he got chance to grab the oval cabinet a he is not liberal shadi hamid seems right not believing that human naturally inclined toward liberalism moreover some men continue to remain sexist if they don confess it they keep this deep inside woman frequently like more bad guy than respectable family men they may not confess it but this sometimes reveals where their sympathy lie and how they vote large number of white american continue to show racist tendency while call for toler ance go on the influx of immigrant gave fertile ground for racism and somehow xeno phobia during these election it appeared that the american had to choose between two candi date with little credibility they opted for change and fresh idea also the turnout wa far lesser than on the previous election which indicates disillusionment over the current presi dential campaign and both the candidate popular vote show the deep divide in the american society with clinton showing ad vantage over trump however it wa the u electoral system that brought trump to power homeland and foreign policy apparently he is set to make america great again not by foreign policy and imposing it will but by boosting the economy retuning to manufacturing and giving new job there is also possibility that he will put even foreign policy based on business tie so no help or assis tance could come for free or without concomitant advantage for the economy the tycoon that he ha been trump is aware that money decides everything he will proba bly try to implement this rule in policymaking both at home and abroad the main motive of the foreign policy could turn into bargain trading and profit trump is not going to be easy for the arab leader you guy are out of business these were his word in response to journalist asking about the president elect policy vision toward the middle east pro israeli and mostly anti arab he will not try to solve arab prob lem anymore however he will continue the u fight against terrorism and probably be more hawkish than clinton in any case he will not be inclined to treat the arab a equal partner such an attitude is going to be unacceptable for the middle easter power and could lead to cooling of tie the same fate e no ally just business probably awaits europe trump and russia russia which wa frequently debated during the campaign is neither winner nor looser after this election first of all no one really know who is mr trump and what he is going to do secondly he ha senate and congress which will not let him do whatever he like moreover an anti russian spirit prevails in the u no matter what with senate and the congress both in republican hand they are likely to seriously limit his intention a he will have to balance between what he want and what he actually can however this man is hard to deal with so pressure group and other instrument of man agement of the u policy will not probably work with trump even if there is shift in the u russia relation this will take long time such shift is needed anyway and confrontation isn good for the whole world trump is probably de fined to press the reboot button in russian relation and russia doesn need weak u russia need to speak with the u to listen and to be heard trump a businessman seems exactly that kind of figure we are entering into new era that will be hardly predictable but extremely interesting clinton had many card on her hand but failed to play them the right way trump ha out smarted her game of poker ha never been so relevant a an analogy spicy 45th season of the united state

              " 'former alaska gov sarah palin the 2008 republican vice presidential nominee and the first major gop figure to endorse president donald trump is calling out house speaker paul ryan for what she say is ryan introduced what he call the american health care act bill that doe not repeal obamacare but only amends it for the last several day senior republican ranging from member of the house freedom caucus to other house republican to sen tom cotton rand paul mike lee and more have raised serious concern with the bill some call it obamacare 2 0 others call it obamacare lite or and now palin in her first interview on the topic coming on breitbart news saturday on siriusxm 125 the patriot channel this weekend call it do want to speak about this but am tempted to say not another word from our fearless leader about this new form of obamacare that m going to call not another word from them until we are definitively told that there is no provision whatsoever allowing congress to exempt itself whatsoever with this law palin said a with anything else mandated by congress every single dotted and crossed better apply to them too and not just the people who they are lording this thing over because remember this is health care the system that requires enrollment in an unaffordable unsustainable unwanted unconstitutional continuation of medicine and even in this new proposal there is still an aspect of socialism that the whole premise here palin expressed serious concern with the fact that ryan healthcare bill doe not eliminate obamacare individual mandate it just shift the mandate which requires all american to purchase health insurance plan even if they do not want one under obamacare those who do not comply pay tax to the federal government under ryan plan those who not comply pay fee to the insurance company this 30 percent additional fee will be collected by some in the private sector which will mean politician are allowed again to pick the winner and loser and it make you wonder who lobbying hardest for aspect of this new bill because obviously there are special interest involved otherwise certain private sector segment of our economy wouldn be rewarded a they will be with this fee instead of going to the irs going to private company palin said it would be really helpful if every single one of these politician would do like the nascar driver do and it been said before but let them wear their sponsor plastered all over their suit when they show up so we know what side they re on and who they re actually doing their bidding for at this time house gop leadership official are refusing to answer which lobbyist specifically were involved in writing the bill and which lobbyist wrote which part of the legislation palin told breitbart news that it a great question for leadership official that they should answer because the public deserves to know that a great question that a great question palin said when informed of the fact that house gop leader have refused to answer which lobbyist were involved in writing the legislation the people want to know with this we know that it help big pharma and big lobbyist who need big government to stay in business we want to and have the right to know who actually putting pen to paper and writing this because we know the politician don write the law palin also praised cotton and paul and rep dave brat among others who are standing up and pushing back on this rush from leadership on this bill she say that they are right in pushing to make sure the process is not rushed in the way that ryan ha been rushing it through the house so far in fact this past week the house energy and commerce and way and mean committee stayed in session all night to ram the bill down to the next stage rather than taking input from the american people and slowly deliberating the process of healthcare reform cotton is right dr rand paul is right dave brat is right some of these public servant are right in saying let do it right this time because remember the rush job under obamacare gave u what we re having to deal with today which is the devastating system that is again lorded over u palin said they passed it with their process of theirs it very important that the people are allowed to see what in the bill before it first draft so we know what their thinking is so we know what the difference is between obamacare and but we can lose sight of the entire premise between the whole and the argument she continued it so wrong because it still so unconstitutional it still taxation without representation it still pick winner and loser because some corporation get to opt out of the requirement that hit everyone else it still infringes on state right and it still weaponizes the irs against american who just simply seek freedom and choice and sensibility in their family health care the irs will be taxing aspect of this without representation because we have no choice we re shackled to politician whim and special interest bullying interest which doe violate the constitution and it actually allows government to have lien on our health people need to know it the foundation it the premise palin said don know why we re still even giving an inch on aspect of socialized medicine via this new proposal is that okay with conservative with republican in office they say they want the patient first they say they want freedom they say they want free market to drive the insurance system that we have in america but no government is still in control government actually ha lien on our health because they lord over u penalty if we want to opt out of big government mandate when asked what she would say to ryan if he were on breitbart news saturday with her this weekend ryan ha refused to come on the program to discus these matter and will not answer breitbart news question about the bill palin said she ha lot for ryan to explain here but she also noted that republican agree that obamacare is awful and need to be repealed there is much that we agree on palin said thank the lord we all agree that obamacare is devastating of our economy that what health care encompasses once the government took it over it obviously is unaffordable unsustainable and unwanted so from the thank the lord we all have that in common and we want to do away with obamacare would ask paul ryan forgiveness if come across sounding like m just whining and complaining about problem without proposing solution like teddy roosevelt said that is the definition of whining so want to propose solution and want paul ryan to listen to the people who are suggesting that okay if government is going to be this involved in our healthcare system and choice then allow the state to take this over get it out of big government hand the most responsive level of government is that which is closest to the people if you re not going to allow individual to have the freedom and the autonomy and the choice provided in their health care at least let it be state right issue so that one and then let talk about the tort reform that still don see in the new proposal palin continued d like paul ryan to address that more clearly d like him to really talk about how he proposes to tackle the waste and the fraud in the healthcare system d really like him to talk about the interstate commerce allowance now because we know that that ha caused lack of competition and really want him to address just that good old american freedom of choice how can he convince the american people that this isn just still big government in bed with big pharma and big wall street and sticking it to the people with all it globaloney that wa part of obamacare how is this any different palin concluded the interview by noting that she ha the utmost confidence that president trump will move to scrap ryan bill and fix this whole process before this get out of hand he will step in and fix it palin said have great faith that president trump is one who will fulfill campaign promise he already ha track record of doing so well in these first month m just really proud to have been part of the constituency that wanted him in there and worked hard to get him in there so yeah m sure that president trump is going to do the right thing and listen to all side of course but understand especially that a businessman he going to understand whether this make sense in his vision of how to grow business and how to get government off our back and back on our side how will we create smaller smarter government with proposal like this that basically allows for the continuation of growth of government that what any aspect of obamacare or doe so asking president trump specifically about how running business not wall street business but main street business how doe help their business get to grow and drive and survive in this economy listen to former alaska gov sarah palin on breitbart news saturday',\n",

her thought m dietrick joined nick denton gawker founder and chief executive at companywide meeting there they told some 200 employee that gawker facing 140 million judgment from lawsuit by the retired wrestler hulk hogan had filed for bankruptcy and wa putting itself up for sale a she stood beside mr denton and delivered the news m dietrick said in an interview over the weekend she looked at her audience could tell there wa initial shock seeing everyone and looking them in the eye m dietrick and mr denton spent much of the meeting answering question and assuring the employee that the company planned to continue it operation during it bankruptcy a ha recently become customary m dietrick did most of the talking since joining gawker three year ago m dietrick 35 ha become the main source of support during chaotic time for the company most general counsel work in obscurity but m dietrick with the added responsibility of president ha taken on more of leadership role at gawker a mr denton ha pulled back from the operation throughout the hulk hogan case she ha been the bridge between the newsroom and gawker legal proceeding she manages much of the company editorial operation and ha formal role in editorial and though mr denton is still arguably the public face of gawker she ha been called on repeatedly to represent the company during period of turmoil the place would not

ascendant technology industry and journalism business buffeted by financial challenge in the interview on saturday m dietrick said that gawker began seriously considering filing for bankruptcy once mr thiel involvement in the hogan case became known the pivotal moment came on friday at around 11 m after hearing in which florida judge affirmed the 140 million judgment in the hogan case and granted gawker request for stay but under condition that the company found too onerous m dietrick said the condition included allowing hulk hogan whose real name is terry bollea to get lien on the company asset gawker had considered the option of filing for bankruptcy within few day m dietrick said but a it lawyer in florida provided update on the hearing by phone she and mr denton decided the company could not wait any longer because they feared it would be unable to continue to operate otherwise the timeline wa pushed forward little more quickly than we expected m dietrick said on saturday a of yesterday it wa inevitable that we were going to go through with the sale the company still plan to appeal the judgment gawker ha had it fair share of detractor and on twitter and in comment in news article some cheered the company fate m dietrick said any suggestion that gawker got what it deserved wa absurd she said that the company had certainly overstepped the line couple of time but that it wa proud of nearly all of the story it had done over the year m dietrick said she wa committed to staying at gawker but acknowledged that it future wa uncertain the company said on friday that it

ha gained the trust of editorial staff member who view her more a partner than an adversary woman at gawker say they see her a an advocate at company that ha been criticized in the past for how it treat female employee she often work on her laptop on couch in the lounge area near the editorial team and go out for drink with employee on friday evening she invited staff member to rooftop gathering at her apartment building in the west village where she life with her husband people ordered pizza and drank beer m dietrick firmly belief in gawker approach to news current and former

cook gawker medium executive editor last july gawker published an article claiming that married male medium executive had sought to hire gay escort the article drew firestorm of criticism and there wa considerable debate at the company about whether to remove the post mr denton ultimately decided to take it down after vote that he said showed that the company management including m dietrick wa largely in favor of doing so but m dietrick maintained that she wanted to keep it online and that her stance wa misconstrued knew the world wa going to have discussion about it she said think it hard to talk about thing once they ve been disappeared some colleague suggest that her numerous role may have stretched her too thin she actually ha more job than one human should probably have said hamilton nolan writer who ha worked at gawker for eight year some in the medium legal community question whether it make sense for m dietrick to hold general counsel and president role acting a both executive and lawyer they say can complicate privilege m dietrick said she did not think her dual role wa that odd but acknowledged that the last year had been tough feel like my job ha been removing

الأمم المتحدة والمنظمات الإقليمية ودون الإقليمية في صون السلام والأمن الدوليين منظمة معاهدة الأمن الجماعي ومنظمة شنغهاي للتعاون ورابطة الدول المستقلة ورقة مفاهيمية يعتزم الاتحاد الروسي أن يعقد مناقشة في 28 تشرين الأول أكتوبر بشأن موضوع التعاون بين الأمم المتحدة والمنظمات الإقليمية ودون الإقليمية في صون السلام والأمن الدوليين منظمة معاهدة الأمن الجماعي ومنظمة شنغهاي للتعاون ورابطة الدول المستقلة وذلك بوصفها محور فترة رئاسته لمجلس الأمن في ضوء الطابع العالمي للتحديات والتهديدات المعاصرة تتطلب صياغة النهج الجماعية اللازمة للتصدي لها بفعالية تعزيز التعاون بين الأمم المتحدة والمنظمات الإقليمية ودون الإقليمية في صون السلام والأمن الدوليين وفيما يتعلق بالأمم المتحدة يرتبط ذلك في المقام الأول بطابعها العالمي وذلك من حيث عضوية المنظمة وعملها على السواء وكذلك بشرعيتها المعترف بها دوليا وبالمقابل فإن المنظمات الإقليمية غالبا ما تتمتع بفهم أفضل للحالة في المجالات التي تندرج في نطاق مسؤولياتها وفي الكثير من الحالات تكون مجهزة بآليات وقائية وآليات لحفظ السلام تتكيف مع الحقائق المحلية ومن المهم في هذا الصدد أن تكون أنشطة المنظمات الإقليمية موجهة نحو السعي إلى إيجاد حلول سياسية سلمية للنزاعات الناشئة وفي هذا السياق تحديدا يكتسب التنسيق المنتظم مع الشركاء الإقليميين الرئيسيين للأمم المتحدة بشأن المسائل المتعلقة بصون السلام والأمن الدوليين أهمية بالغة فعلى سبيل المثال يعقد مجلس الأمن اجتماعات منتظمة بشأن التعاون مع الاتحاد الأفريقي ومنظمة الأمن والتعاون في أوروبا والاتحاد الأوروبي وفي السنوات الأخيرة أجريت استعراضات للتعاون مع جامعة الدول العربية ورابطة أمم جنوب شرق آسيا واتحاد أمم أمريكا الجنوبية وغيرها من الجهات الفاعلة الإقليمية ولا يخفى على أحد أن التعاون بين المنظمة وشركائها الإقليميين يغطي مجموعة لا تنفك تتسع من المسائل وتكمل هدفي حفظ السلام وبناء السلام الجهود الرامية إلى مكافحة انتشار أسلحة الدمار الشامل والتدفق غير المشروع للأسلحة الصغيرة والأسلحة الخفيفة ومكافحة الإرهاب الإلكتروني والهجرة غير الشرعية وكلها مجالات يزداد التعاون فيها بين المنظمات المذكورة أعلاه والأمم المتحدة زخما وهذا أمر بالغ الأهمية لصون السلام والاستقرار على امتداد المنطقة الأوروبية الآسيوية المترامية الأطراف وخاصة في منطقة آسيا الوسطى وفي هذا المجال تحديدا تعمل ثلاث منظمات فتية نسبيا في المنطقة الشاسعة الممتدة من أوروبا الشرقية إلى الشرق الأقصى وهي منظمة معاهدة الأمن الجماعي ومنظمة شنغهاي للتعاون ورابطة الدول المستقلة وتعمل هذه المنظمات على بناء نفوذها السياسي في العالم وتسهم إسهاما ملموسا في تعزيز الأمن على الصعيدين الإقليمي والدولي وستركز المناقشات على مساهمة منظمة معاهدة الأمن الجماعي ومنظمة شنغهاي للتعاون ورابطة الدول المستقلة في التصدي للأخطار التي تهد د السلام والأمن في المنطقة بما في ذلك مكافحة الإرهاب والاتجار بالمخدرات والجريمة المنظمة وستوفر هذه المناسبة أيضا فرصة للتأكيد مجددا على التزام هذه المنظمات الثلاث بتطوير التعاون العملي مع الأمم المتحدة بما في ذلك مركزها الإقليمي للدبلوماسية الوقائية لمنطقة آسيا الوسطى وت عد منظمة معاهدة الأمن الجماعي هيكلا متعد د الوجوه قادرا على الاستجابة بقوة للطائفة الواسعة من التحديات والتهديدات المعاصرة التي قد تواجهها الدول الأعضاء فيها وفي هذا الصدد تتوافر فرص جيدة لتعزيز التعاون بين الأمم المتحدة ومنظمة معاهدة الأمن الجماعي في مجال حفظ السلام وفي إطار منظمة معاهدة الأمن الجماعي يجري العمل بشكل مكثف من أجل تطوير القدرات الخاصة بها على حفظ السلام بما في ذلك القدرات التي يمكن أن تتاح لعمليات الأمم المتحدة لحفظ السلام وفي الوقت نفسه تسهم منظمة معاهدة الأمن الجماعي بنشاط في الجهود الدولية لإعادة الإعمار بعد انتهاء النزاع في أفغانستان وتحييد خطر المخدرات النابع من إقليم ذلك البلد وتتطو ر علاقات منظمة معاهدة الأمن الجماعي مع الأمم المتحدة بنجاح في مجالات عديدة منها مكافحة الإرهاب والاتجار بالمخدرات وحفظ السلام ومكافحة الجريمة المنظمة وتحافظ منظمة معاهدة الأمن الجماعي على صلات مثمرة مع هياكل الأمم المتحدة المتخص صة وتعمل على تطويرها بما في ذلك لجنة مكافحة الإرهاب التابعة لمجلس الأمن ومكتب الأمم المتحدة المعني بالمخدرات والجريمة وكل سنتين تتخذ الجمعية العامة قرارا بشأن التعاون بين الأمم المتحدة ومنظمة معاهدة الأمن الجماعي ومن المقرر اتخاذ قرار بشأن هذا الموضوع في الدورة الحادية والسبعين في سياق النظر في بند جدول الأعمال المعنون التعاون بين الأمم المتحدة والمنظمات الإقليمية والمنظمات الأخرى ولقد أ نشئ الإطار القانوني للتعاون بين الأمم المتحدة ومنظمة شنغهاي للتعاون بشأن قضايا السلام والأمن الدوليين وفقا للفصل الثامن من ميثاق الأمم المتحدة بتوقيع إعلان مشترك بشأن التعاون بين أمانتي المنظمتين عام 2010 وفي الوقت الراهن تتعاون منظمة شنغهاي للتعاون والأمم المتحدة تعاونا نشطا في مجالات من قبيل منع نشوب النزاعات وحلها ومكافحة الإرهاب ولهذا الغرض يعمل هيكل إقليمي لمكافحة الإرهاب داخل منظمة شنغهاي

المجتمع الدولي وهيئات الأمم المتحدة الرامية إلى استعادة السلام في أفغانستان وتدعو باستمرار إلى الحفاظ على الدور التنسيقي المركزي الذي تضطلع به الأمم المتحدة في عملية التسوية الأفغانية ولقد كان التعاون في ضمان الأمن والتصدي للتحديات والتهديدات المعاصرة دائما وسيظل أحد المجالات ذات الأولوية للتعاون المتكامل بين الدول الأعضاء في رابطة الدول المستقلة ويعتبر التعاون البن اء مع المنظمات الدولية أيضا عاملا رئيسيا في مكافحة التهديدات المستجدة بفعالية ودول رابطة الدول المستقلة أطراف في جميع أهم الصكوك الدولية التي تنظم التعاون في ضمان الأمن وتعزيز نزع السلاح والتصدي للتحديات والتهديدات المعاصرة وتسهم إسهاما كبيرا في تنفيذها ويجري تنفيذ تدابير مشتركة مع مراعاة الدور القيادي للأمم المتحدة والحاجة إلى تطوير شراكات بن اءة مع الهيئات الدولية الأخرى وهياكلها المتخص صة مثل لجنة مكافحة الإرهاب ومكتب الأمم المتحدة المعني بالمخدرات والجريمة والمنظمة الدولية للشرطة الجنائية الإنتربول والمنظمة الدولية للهجرة ومفوضية الأمم المتحدة لشؤون اللاجئين وفرقة العمل المعنية بالإجراءات المالية المتعلقة بغسل الأموال ويؤدي استمرار تعزيز التعاون وتوثيقه بين الأمم المتحدة ومنظمة معاهدة الأمن الجماعي ومنظمة شنغهاي للتعاون ورابطة الدول المستقلة على أساس الفصل الثامن من ميثاق الأمم المتحدة دورا بن اء في تعزيز أهداف المنظمة بما في ذلك مجابهة التحديات والتهديدات المعاصرة ويجب أن تحد د هذه المنظمات الإقليمية موقعها بصورة فاعلة من حيث توظيف إمكانياتها لمصلحة الأمم المتحدة وفي الوقت نفسه ينبغي للأمم المتحدة نفسها أن تواصل إيلاء الاهتمام اللازم إلى زيادة التنسيق والتعاون مع تلك المنظمات في إطار التقيد الصارم باختصاصات المنظمة ومجلس الأمن التابع لها وفي هذا السياق نود أن نقترح أن تقدم الدول الأعضاء رؤيتها الخاصة عن السبل الكفيلة بتعزيز الأمن في المنطقة الأوروبية الآسيوية باستخدام الآليات الإقليمية القائمة ومن الواضح أن الاستقرار في هذه المنطقة الكبرى سيكون الأساس لتحقيق النمو الاقتصادي وبناء الدولة للبلدان الأوروبية الآسيوية ولذلك نرح ب بآراء الوفود بما في ذلك بشأن الصلة القائمة بين الأمن والتنمية ونحن مقتنعون بأننا هنا في الأمم المتحدة التي تتمتع بالشرعية العالمية سنتمكن بشكل جماعي من اقتراح ن

              " 'written by adam dick it is common in presidential campaign for surrogate to speak at event or take part in medium interview where they vouch for presidential candidate democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton ha many such surrogate including her former presidential primary opponent bernie sander her husband and former united state president bill clinton and first lady michelle obama hillary clinton campaign a is typical of presidential campaign also us clinton vice presidential running mate tim kaine a surrogate what is unusual is that bill weld the vice presidential nominee of the libertarian party ha also joined the rank of clinton surrogate weld interviewed tuesday at msnbc by rachel maddow said that he wa on her show to vouch for hillary clinton and vouch for clinton he did throughout the interview asked by maddow if people should vote for the libertarian presidential ticket in state where there appears to be close race between clinton and republican nominee donald trump weld answered that weld fear for the country if trump is elected that trump is stirring up envy and resentment and even hatred and that trump threatens u foreign policy and the nation position in the world at large weld did not say vote for clinton but it is easy for viewer of the interview to fill in those blank not satisfied with weld implicit call for voter to support clinton maddow pushed for more explicit direction from weld and weld obliged asked why person would vote for the libertarian ticket headed by presidential nominee gary johnson in state with close clinton versus trump race weld answered that he ha lot to say about clinton to such voter who choose not to vote libertarian weld proceeded praising clinton who he say he ha known for 40 year and ha worked with professionally know her well personally know her to be person of high moral character reliable person and an honest person however so much mr trump may rant and rave to the contrary weld continued in contrast weld in the interview argued that trump behaves like bully and cannot competently manage the office of the presidency narrowing in more on weld vote recommendation maddow proceeded to ask weld the following question do you honestly believe that gary johnson would be better president than hillary clinton breaking from expectation based on the history of american vice presidential nominee weld did not say that the head of his presidential ticket would be the best choice for president and then launch into list of reason instead weld gave lukewarm praise for johnson while sidestepping the direct question think he be capable of being good chief executive and yes commander in chief said weld regarding johnson weld then returned in his answer to his focus on how clinton is much better choice for voter than is trump asserting that president trump would bring chaos to the country while president clinton would bring very businesslike and capable and competent approach to our affair included in weld defense of clinton is his declaration during the interview that people should just ignore because there is nothing there the friday disclosure by federal bureau of investigation fbi director james comey that the fbi ha reopened it investigation of clinton for mishandling classified information maddow then questioned weld regarding whether his opinion on the matter conflict with press release in which johnson start off saying a quoted by maddow the newest revelation about hillary clinton demonstrate why america should be scared of both clinton and trump asked by maddow if weld agrees with the press release weld confirmed that he doe not weld then immediately proceeded in his answer to list number of substantive issue on which he disagrees with johnson something weld did not do in regard to clinton weld divergence from the expected message of libertarian party vice presidential nominee should not be too surprising on may 19 the day after johnson declared his preference that the libertarian national convention delegate choose weld for the vice presidential slot jesse walker writing at reason pointed to weld anti libertarian position on both domestic and foreign issue before concluding if wanted to elect an iraq hawk for gun control could vote for hillary clinton several month later weld ha come out in the open to effectively answer walker with resounding hear hear since his nomination at the libertarian national convention weld ha continued to endorse position contrary to the libertarian party platform and libertarian idea these position include outlawing people listed on the u government so called terror watch list from buying gun and nominating far from libertarian individual to the u supreme court weld ha also been busy promoting clinton during his time a the libertarian vice presidential nominee though maybe never before so brazenly a in his interview this week with maddow in september for example weld declared in an msnbc interview that he think very highly of clinton and that he is not sure anybody more qualified than hillary clinton to be president of the united state then last week weld issued statement directed to people who are undecided between voting for clinton or trump that go on and on about how terrible trump is but neglect to suggest voting for the libertarian ticket weld appears to have been in the tank for clinton for quite while curious observer would have to wonder if weld ha supported clinton election since before his nomination at the libertarian national convention with so many republican establishment individual opposing trump and even jumping to support clinton it is not far fetched to think an effort would be made to put clinton supporter on the libertarian presidential ticket indeed david french who bill kristol wa once promoting a potential independent presidential candidate to foil trump wrote national review article expressing his desire that the libertarian national convention delegate nominate presidential candidate that anti trump republican could support french suggested that johnson may be alright in the top spot on the ticket though french also expressed some reservation weld might very much satisfy many such never trumpers by using his platform a the vice presidential nominee to encourage people to vote for clinton watch weld interview with

              " 'rare is the individual who hasn tripped over pet or uneven pavement tumbled off bike slipped on ice or maybe wiped out skiing or skating some get injured while others go unhurt often claiming it because they knew how to fall according to paratrooper stunt professional physical therapist and martial art instructor there is indeed right way to fall and it can save you lot of grief if you know how to do it although often associated with older people fall occur at any age and are the most common cause of injury seen in emergency room in the united state the agency for healthcare research and quality estimate that fall cause more than third of emergency room visit around 7 9 million year a physical therapist we talk lot about preventing fall but what we don talk about is what to do when you actually do fall said jessica schwartz physical therapist in new york city who train athlete and people with prosthetic limb to fall without hurting themselves it almost inevitable you are going to fall so you really should know what to do the number one thing to remember she said is to protect your head so if you find yourself falling pivot to your side and tuck in your head have you seen those slip and fall cartoon where the character fall flat on their back or face don do that said dr schwartz you ll hit your head like coconut and get concussion and the reverse motion or bounce of your head after impact will give you something like whiplash moreover falling straight forward or backward raise the risk of damaging your spine and vital organ the other thing to avoid she said is foosh an acronym for falling onto outstretched hand if you do that all the force of impact will be concentrated there raising the risk of breaking your wrist you similarly don want to come crashing down on your knee so you break your kneecap or do that maneuver where you kind of pedal with your foot to catch yourself which can lead to broken bone in your foot and ankle instead if you feel yourself falling expert said you should bend your elbow and knee and try to take the hit on the fleshiest part of your body like the side of your thigh buttock and shoulder aim for the meat not bone said kevin inouye stuntman and assistant professor of acting movement and stage combat at the university of wyoming your instinct will be to reach out with hand or try to catch yourself with your knee or foot but they are hard and not forgiving when you go down the key is to not fight the fall but just to roll with it a paratrooper do the idea is to orient your body to the ground so when you hit there a multistep process of hitting and shifting your body weight to break up that impact said sgt first class chuck davidson master trainer at the army advanced airborne school at ft bragg c paratrooper goal is to fall sideways in the direction the wind is carrying them in no way resisting the momentum of the fall when the ball of their foot barely reach the ground they immediately distribute the impact in rapid sequence up through the calf to the thigh and buttock then they roll over on the latissimus dorsi muscle the large flat muscle running laterally down the side of your back and kick their foot over shifting their weight so they end up supine with leg bent in front of them the procedure is strikingly similar to how martial art practitioner learn to take fall when they are say thrown over someone shoulder or have their leg knocked out from under them would say the principle we follow are accept that you re falling and go with it round your body and don stiffen and distribute the energy so you take the fall in the widest area possible said paul schreiner black belt jiu jitsu instructor at marcelo garcia academy in new york city while martial art fall often have gymnastic aspect with rather elegant and snappy kind of somersault it still all about spreading out the force of impact there may be an aesthetic component but what it doe is save the body said mr schreiner if you don take the fall in any single place you ll still walk out sore but you ll walk out of there difficult a it may sound a you re hurtling toward the ground medical bill and disability flashing through your mind expert said it important to relax a you fall you re le likely to hurt yourself if you soften up all your muscle and exhale rigidity is your enemy while pliability is your friend a unfair a it is that why people who are drunk tend to be the one who don get hurt in car crash said mr inouye they are loose and just flop around of course you will be better able to loosen up pivot to your side tuck and roll if you are in good physical condition if you have room full of soccer player and computer desk worker and go around knocking people over you can bet the soccer player are going to be le likely to get hurt because of their superior strength agility and coordination said erik moen physical therapist in kenmore wash but that doesn mean you have to be an elite athlete or paratrooper to fall the right way young child are arguably the best faller because they have yet to develop fear or embarrassment so they just tumble and roll without tensing up and trying to catch themselves physical therapist can be helpful in assessing your weakness and prescribing exercise to improve your strength and agility for example jumping from side to side and on and off platform or step so that you will be better able to execute fall a well a lessen the risk that you will fall in the first place',\n",

republican senator like mr toomey who are running in swing state about six and enough to tip the balance of power in the senate need voter who would reject donald trump to nonetheless pull the lever for the party other candidate in november in some district house republican will need them too mr trump convincing sweep of the primary in connecticut delaware maryland pennsylvania and rhode island on tuesday did little to assuage concern about his standing with swing voter in november his victory speech included bracing broadside against hillary clinton playing the woman card and he continues to trail his opponent senator ted cruz of texas and gov john kasich of ohio among republican woman but voter in federal race have become increasingly rare over the last two decade hitting low in 2012 when only 10 percent of them divided their vote between party that wa down sharply from 1972 the rank of voter have expanded along with the rise in partisanship and it attendant rancor in congress there is no doubt that over all the era of polarization and above and beyond idiosyncratic factor that ha to lead to drop in ticket splitting said richard born professor of political science at vassar college and an expert on congressional election democrat and republican alike a part of the polarization phenomenon are more consistently liberal or conservative across issue mr born said a are the candidate themselves meaning le likelihood of ticket splitting even in pennsylvania state that ha elected senator from different party than the presidential candidate it chose seven time since world war ii ticket splitting ha decreased drastically in recent election that is probably toomey worst problem said terry madonna the director of the center for politics and public affair at franklin and marshall college it is also problem for the republican senator kelly ayotte of new hampshire ron johnson of wisconsin mark kirk of illinois and rob portman of ohio republican in washington are increasingly worried for them senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky the majority leader and other republican are openly urging elected official in their party to focus largely on local issue and their role in bipartisan legislation and to refrain from tying themselves to the top of the ticket should the nominee be mr trump think we have to go out and make case said representative scott perry republican who represents the york area people don split their ticket because they don have choice it because they do think those people are going to need to be convinced while polarizing presidential candidate is considered very difficult for republican senator to overcome in swing state there may be silver lining for them some republican donor are quietly plotting to dismiss mr trump and instead pour their money into senate race where they believe republican can be saved a check and balance to democrat sitting in the white house for the next four year the prospect of trump at the top of the ticket could create an exodus of donor away from the presidential and toward senate and house race said kevin madden republican strategist the potential is there for concentration of effort and resource geared toward senate race that chuck schumer and his senate democrat may not have been counting on mr schumer new yorker who is poised to become the next leader of the senate democrat say good luck with that if there wa ever national election this is it he said they can run from their nominee but they can hide ticket splitting over the last five decade ha occurred most often among moderate democrat who have supported republican for president but voted for democrat for congress some voter have viewed this a recipe for compromise and balance while others have been repelled by the democratic candidate running for the top job the three strongest year of ticket splitting between presidential and house voting in the last five decade according to american national election study survey data were 1972 when 30 percent of voter did it 1980 28 percent and 1984 26 percent similar study show the same trend for senate race in all three of those election republican won the white house by landslide at time when registered democrat significantly outnumbered republican in the overall population and when considerably more incumbent house member were democrat the 1928 election provides history lesson in what can happen when candidate rather than the political mood drive ticket splitting that year al smith the governor of new york became the democratic nominee it wa not extreme rhetoric like mr trump engages in which ha repelled some republican that held mr smith back with voter mr smith wa roman catholic opposed prohibition and wa symbol of modern urbanism and that combination drove off rural and moderate southern democrat who outnumbered republican significantly contributing to his loss to the republican herbert hoover while republican made net gain of eight seat in the senate that year demonstrating that ticket splitting doe not help all senator attached to the party of wildly unpopular candidate many democrat still voted along party line for the house and senate in 1996 when it wa clear that bill clinton would trounce bob dole republican encouraged voter to stick with their party in the down ballot and newt gingrich then speaker of the house cautioned his member to distance themselves from mr dole mr gingrich came up with parallel house agenda much a speaker paul ryan is now doing and he told member to run on it it saved the house and the senate for them said mr born the vassar professor trying to localize the campaign paid off but republican ticket splitter may make an alternative choice that is equally damaging to mr toomey prospect might just skip the whole thing said kristi peyton 46 toomey fan who offered her view of mr trump disaster bully and unattractive over crab at captain bob in railroad small town near york where

tennessee adopt free speech policy consistent with the university of chicago 2015 stone report chaired by chicago law professor geoffrey stone the report finding were adopted last year to great fanfare despite his emphasis on campus free speech professor stone is hardly ideologue he clerked with archliberal supreme court justice william brennan chaired the board of the american constitution society leading lawyer association and served on the national advisory council of the american civil liberty union the tennessee law will expressly prohibit the use of free speech zone to limit the area of campus on which certain viewpoint can be heard university administrator are prohibited from rescinding the invitation from student or faculty of speaker with whom they disagree or fear will cause disruption the law also demand campus use the actual legal definition of harassment handed down by the supreme court behavior so severe pervasive and objectively offensive and that so undermines and detracts from the victim educational experience that the are effectively denied equal access to an institution resource and opportunity according to group instrumental in advocating free speech on campus the foundation for individual right in education fire far lower standard of harassment are routinely used by administrator to prohibit speech that distress or cause emotional discomfort to some student finally the campus free speech protection act will forbid discrimination in the distribution of fund for student group and prevent faculty from being punished for what they choose to say in the classroom unless it is not reasonably germane to the subject matter of the class a broadly construed and comprises substantial portion of classroom instruction the law come at time when the

columnist ann coulter for example saw her invited speaking engagement at university of california berkeley last month moved curtailed and finally canceled because of security concern the threat of leftist violence gave administrator the cover needed to add greater requirement on her event those same threat were made good only two month earlier when berkeley police and university of california security stood down while violent rioter ran rampant assaulting student destroying property and forcing the cancellation of much heralded event by news tech editor milo yiannopoulos on the other side of the country the same tactic with the tacit approval of campus leadership led to the physical assault of professor at ruined speaking engagement by harvard social scientist and american enterprise institute scholar charles murray at middlebury college in vermont instead of taking stand against this agitation and fighting for the diversity of viewpoint in their institution university in recent year have imposed politically correct speech code on student and faculty restricted controversial speech to free speech zone and actively torpedoed primarily student group and invited speaker the tennessee law represents growing movement by state legislature to counter these trend in the public institution over which they have authority it represents perhaps the broadest combination so far

              " 'behind much of the middle east chaos the war in syria and yemen the political upheaval in iraq and lebanon and bahrain there is another conflict saudi arabia and iran are waging struggle for dominance that ha turned much of the middle east into their battlefield rather than fighting directly they wield and in that way worsen the region direst problem dictatorship militia violence and religious extremism the history of their rivalry track and help to explain the middle east disintegration particularly the sectarianism both power have found useful to cultivate it is story in which the united state ha been supporting but constant player most recently by backing the saudi war in yemen which kill hundred of civilian these dynamic scholar warn point toward future of civil war divided society and unstable government gregory gause iii an international relation scholar at texas m university struggled to name another region that had been torn apart in this way central africa could be similar he suggested referring to the two decade of interrelated war and genocide that driven by meddling regional power killed five million but in the middle east it is just getting started saudi arabia young country pieced together only in the 1930s ha built it legitimacy on religion by promoting it stewardship of the holy site at mecca and medina it could justify it royal family grip on power iran revolution in 1979 threatened that legitimacy iranian toppled their authoritarian government installing islamist who claimed to represent revolution for the entire islamic world said kenneth pollack senior fellow at the brookings institution the revolutionary encouraged all muslim especially saudi to overthrow their ruler a well but because iran is mostly shiite they had the greatest influence with and tended to reach out to shia group dr pollack said some saudi shiite who make up about 10 percent of the population protested in solidarity or even set up office in tehran stoking saudi fear of internal unrest and separatism this wa the opening shot in the sectarianization of their rivalry which would encompass the whole region the saudi have looked at iran a domestic threat from the from 1979 dr gause said seeing the threat a intolerable they began looking for way to strike back they found that way the next year when saddam hussein iraq invaded iran hoping to seize territory saudi arabia dr pollack said backed the iraqi to the hilt because they want the iranian revolution stopped the war over eight year of trench warfare and chemical weapon attack killed perhaps million people it set pattern of struggle through proxy and of sucking in the united state whose policy is to maintain access to the vast oil and gas reserve that lie between the rival the conflict toll exhausted iran zeal for sowing revolution abroad but gave it new mission to overturn the regional order that tehran saw a an existential threat that sense of insecurity would later drive iran meddling abroad said marc lynch political scientist at george washington university and perhaps it missile and nuclear program the 1990s provided pause in the regional rivalry but also set up the condition that would allow it to later explode in such force saudi arabia wishing to contain iran reach to the region minority shiite population sought to harden rift government program promoted incitement in school islamic university and the medium toby matthiesen an oxford university scholar wrote in brief for the carnegie endowment these policy dr matthiesen warned cultivated sectarian fear and sometimes violence that would later feed into the ideology of the islamic state in 1990 iraq invaded kuwait saudi ally the united state after expelling the iraqi established military base in the region to defend it ally from iraq this further tilted the regional power balance against iran which saw the american force a threat iraq humiliating defeat also spurred many of it citizen to rise up particularly in poorer community that happened to be shiite arab in response dr gause said saddam regime became explicitly sectarian widening divide to deter future uprising that allowed iran still worried about iraq to cultivate ally among iraq increasingly disenfranchised shiite including militia that had risen up though it wa not obvious at the time iraq had become powder keg one that would ignite when it government wa toppled decade later the 2003 invasion by toppling an iraqi government that had been hostile to both saudi arabia and iran upended the region power balance iran convinced that the united state and saudi arabia would install pliant iraqi government and remembering the horror they had inflicted on iran in the 1980s raced to fill the postwar vacuum it leverage with shiite group which are iraq largest demographic group allowed it to influence baghdad politics iran also wielded shiite militia to control iraqi street and undermine the occupation but sectarian violence took on it own inevitable momentum hastening the country slide into civil war saudi arabia sought to match iran reach but after year of oppressing it own shiite population struggled to make inroad with those in iraq the problem for the saudi is that their natural ally in iraq dr gause said referring to sunni group that were increasingly turning to jihadism wanted to kill them this wa the first sign that saudi arabia strategy for containing iran by fostering sectarianism and aligning itself with the region sunni majority had backfired a sunni government collapsed and sunni militia turned to jihadism riyadh would be left with few reliable proxy a their competition in iraq heated up saudi arabia and iran sought to counterbalance each other through another weak state lebanon lebanon provided the perfect opening frail democracy recovering from civil war with party and lingering militia primarily organized by religion iran and saudi arabia exploited those dynamic waging new kind of proxy struggle not on conventional military battlefield dr gause said but within the domestic politics of weakened institutional structure iran for instance supported hezbollah the shiite militia and political movement which it had earlier cultivated to use against israel riyadh in turn funneled money to political ally such a the sunni prime minister rafik hariri by competing along lebanon religious line they helped drive the lebanese government frequent breakdown a party relied on foreign backer who wanted to oppose one another more than build functioning state with iran promoting hezbollah a the nation defender and saudi arabia backing the lebanese military neither had full mandate and lebanon struggled to maintain order a the foreign power escalated their antagonism lebanon dysfunction spiraled into violence in 2005 after mr hariri called for the withdrawal of syrian troop he wa assassinated hezbollah ha long been suspected another political crisis in 2008 culminated with hezbollah overpowering sunni militia to seize much of beirut saudi arabia requested united state air cover according to wikileaks cable for force to retake the city though the intervention never materialized the episode wa dress rehearsal for the turmoil that would soon come to the wider region when the arab spring toppled government across the middle east many of them saudi ally riyadh feared that iran would again fill the vacuum so it rushed to close them at time with force it promised billion in aid to jordan yemen egypt and others often urging those government to crack down after protester rose up in bahrain saudi ally whose sunni king rule over majority shiite population saudi arabia sent 1 200 troop in egypt saudi arabia tacitly supported 2013 military takeover seeing the military a more reliable ally than the elected islamist government it replaced a libya fell into civil war it backed general who wa driving to consolidate control though iran ha little influence in either country saudi arabia fear of losing ground to iran made it fight harder to retain influence wherever it could analyst believe syria an iranian ally reversed the usual dynamic saudi arabia and other sunni state steered money and arm to rebel including sunni islamist iran intervened in turn sending officer and later hezbollah to fight on behalf of syria government whose leader mostly follow sect of shiism their intervention civil war scholar say helped lock syria in the stalemate that ha killed over 400 000 the united state ha struggled to restore the region balance president obama ha urged iran and saudi arabia to find an effective way to share the neighborhood and institute some sort of cold peace he told the atlantic but dr lynch called this plan for equilibrium between the mideast power the nuclear agreement with iran instead of calming saudi nerve hit on fear that the united state want to abandon them in order to ally with iran dr lynch said calling the belief crazy but widespread mr pollack said he often heard sunni arab leader express this a metaphor they would say what is wrong with you people you have this good loving loyal wife in u and this crazy mistress in iran you don understand how bad she is for you and yet you endlessly run off to her the moment that she wink at you he recounted the white house looked for other way to reassure saudi leader facilitating arm sale and overlooking saudi action in egypt and bahrain then came yemen rebel group with loose tie to iran ousted the president deepening riyadh fear saudi arabia launched bombing campaign that inflicted horror on civilian but accomplished little else the assault receives heavy american support though the united state ha few interest in yemen other than counterterrorism and sometimes criticizes the campaign in exchange riyadh acquiesced to the iran deal and began to follow washington lead on syria but the underlying proxy war remained asked when the struggle might cool mr pollack said he doubted that it would where we re headed with the middle east is the current trend extrapolated with more failed and failing government in yemen this is already reorganizing yemeni society along sectarian line and rearranging people relationship to one another on basis farea an analyst wrote in carnegie endowment paper which cited similar trend across the region continued crisis will risk sucking in the united state again mr lynch said adding that no american president wa likely to persuade saudi arabia or iran to stay out of regional conflict that it saw a potentially existential threat donald trump will enter office having echoed saudi arabia view of the region iran took over iraq he said at rally in january they re going to have yemen they re going to have syria they re going to have everything mentioning both the and hillary clinton dr gause said he doubted that any administration could reset the middle east

united state and abroad about the trustworthiness of technology where cybersecurity can impact human life and public safety there is no evidence that the i hacking tool have been used against american but ben wizner the director of the american civil liberty union speech privacy and technology project said the document suggest that the government ha deliberately allowed vulnerability in phone and other device to persist to make spying easier those vulnerability will be exploited not just by our security agency but by hacker and government around the world mr wizner said patching security hole immediately not stockpiling them is the best way to make everyone digital life safer wikileaks did not identify the source of the document which it called vault 7 but said they had been circulated among former s government hacker and contractor in an unauthorized manner one of whom ha provided wikileaks with portion of the archive wikileaks said the source in statement set out policy question that urgently need to be debated in public including whether the i s hacking capability exceed it mandated power and the problem of public oversight of the agency the source the group said wish to initiate public debate about the security creation use proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons but james lewis an expert on cybersecurity at the center for strategic and international study in washington raised another possibility that foreign state most likely russia stole the document by hacking or other mean and delivered them to wikileaks which may not know how they were obtained mr lewis noted that according to american intelligence agency russia hacked democratic target during the presidential campaign and gave thousand of email to wikileaks for publication think foreign power is much more likely the source of these document than c a mr lewis said at time of increasing concern about the privacy of call and message the revelation did not suggest that the i can actually break the encryption used by popular messaging apps instead by penetrating the user phone the agency can make the encryption irrelevant by intercepting message and call before their content is encrypted or on the other end after message are decrypted wikileaks which ha sometimes been accused of recklessly leaking information that could do harm said it had redacted name and other

some case exotic hacking program one program weeping angel us samsung smart television a covert listening device according to the wikileaks news release even when it appears to be turned off the

other country including russia according to the wikileaks release the large number of technique allows the i to mask the origin of some of it attack and confuse forensic investigator the wikileaks material includes list of software tool that the i us to create exploit and malware to carrying out hacking many of the tool are those used by developer around the world coding language such a python

one of the document is described a reverse engineering environment created by the s the vault 7 release mark the latest in series of huge leak that have changed the landscape for government and corporate secrecy in scale the vault 7 archive appears to fall into the same category a the biggest leak of classified information in recent year including the diplomatic cable taken by chelsea manning the former army intelligence analyst and given to wikileaks in 2010 and the hundred of thousand of national security agency document taken by mr snowden in 2013 in the business world the

communication metadata in his article at requires police to hide hemisphere phone spying schwartz say law enforcement official kept hemisphere under the radar for many year hidden from court legislator and the general public until the new york time exposed the program in 2013 democracy now interview adam schwartz new detail are emerging about how at ha been spying on american for profit with secret plan called project hemisphere the daily beast report at is keeping private call record and selling the information to authority investigating everything from the war on drug to medicaid fraud at reportedly ha been retaining every call text message skype chat or other communication that ha passed through it infrastructure some of the record date back to 1987 sheriff and police department each pay upward of 1 million year for access to the call record no warrant are needed and at requires governmental agency to keep secret the source of the information juan gonzález well all of this come a new detail are emerging about how at ha been spying on american for profit the secret plan is called project hemisphere the daily beast report at is keeping private call record and selling the information to authority investigating everything from the war on drug to medicaid fraud at reportedly ha been retaining every call text message skype chat or other communication that passed through it infrastructure some of the record date back to 1987 sheriff and police department across the country each pay upwards of million dollar year for access to the call record no warrant are needed and at requires governmental agency to keep secret the source of information amy goodman 2014 statement of work from at to the city of atlanta published by the daily beast outline the secrecy at demanded it read quote he government agency agrees not to use the data a evidence in any judicial or administrative proceeding unless there is no other available and admissible probative evidence the government agency shall make every effort to insure that information provided by the contractor is non attributable to at if the data is provided to third party well for more we want to bring in adam schwartz to this conversation senior lawyer at the electronic frontier foundation his latest article at requires police to hide hemisphere phone spying so explain what is this project hemisphere adam schwartz inaudible the largest known possibly the biggest database of telephone metadata that the government is using to spy on u every day the database grows by literally 4 billion record a you said it ha record going back to the 1980s and police are using powerful algorithm to scrutinize this database of everyone that we are having telephone and other digital communication with to discover our personal relationship whether we re talking to psychiatrist or criminal defense lawyer or union organizer on the telephone we view this a menace to our privacy and one of the most disturbing feature of it is how it ha been kept secret so that the public and the court and congress cannot scrutinize this program and decide whether we even want it juan gonzález well and how are they able to do this why are they not why are the law enforcement agency not required to have court ordered subpoena to obtain these record adam schwartz well that a great question under federal statute that protect our privacy ordinarily the police do have to go to judge and get some kind of approval before they get this metadata of who we re talking to what at ha required the police to do through the provision of the contract that you just read is what the police call parallel construction and what the eff call evidence laundering and what this mean is after the police find evidence against someone in the hemisphere database they wall it off quote unquote from their training manual and then they use traditional subpoena to recreate the exact same evidence trail and when it come time to put the person on trial they present the second set of cleaner evidence and no one is the wiser that they were using this massive disturbing digital database to spy on all american including the criminal suspect juan gonzález but wouldn there be requirement for the company to at least notify their consumer that they re participating in something like this adam schwartz yeah unfortunately there isn you know at in it public comment about hemisphere ha suggested they are merely responding to government request for information the same way that all kind of provider of consumer service have to respond in fact a we see through the contract that at wrote which came to light earlier this week in the daily beast it is at who wa demanding of government that the program be kept secret we don know what at s motive is to demand the secrecy perhaps it because at is literally making million of dollar year from government agency in exchange for providing this unique database of telephone record to the police for their scrutiny amy goodman so the police might pay up to one police department somewhere might pay like million dollar to get this information adam schwartz yeah just to be clear there is task force of federal state and local official called the hidtas the high intensity drug trafficking area and it is funded by the white house office of national drug control policy and the hidtas have three regional center across the country where at employee are posted along with dea agent and other law enforcement and that is the entry point for law enforcement to the at hemisphere database and the funding is little bit shadowy but it is clear that at one of these three hidta center white house fund to the tune of million dollar year are going to the hidta in turn going to at so it not million dollar from each agency but it is million of dollar in total juan gonzález and adam schwartz am correct on this that at is not doe not only provide information on their own customer but on other carrier who possibly may be going through the at infrastructure a well adam schwartz that exactly correct any consumer whether they are not whether or not they are with at when call go through an at switch it go into the hemisphere database so for example if you re using roaming away from your own carrier network and you re using at s network then your call go into the hemisphere database again 4 billion record per day from american consumer and for international call into the hemisphere database amy goodman and the significance of broadband internet provider having to ask permission if they want to sell customer private data to third party the ruling that wa just adopted thursday by the fcc adam schwartz you know think that the critical principle here is that consumer should have control over their data and corporation should not be diverting that data for their own profit reason we think that program like amy goodman that they could sell it to other company you re saying they could not only to police agency but to corporation they could sell your you know our text to each other adam schwartz right the ruling yesterday from the fcc which the electronic frontier foundation wa strongly in support of and lobbied for say that they have to get each individual consumer permission before they divert their private information to anything other than providing the standard broadband service so there a parallel between that issue and the hemisphere issue which is that you know consumer have right to privacy and at should not be undermining that privacy in the case of hemisphere by creating the world biggest if or one of the world biggest database to allow the government to scrutinize our private relationship based on who we are having digital correspondence with juan gonzález and craig aaron of free press your sense of how this information on the hemisphere program whether this is going to become now part of the overall discussion on at s increased market power if it ha this merger craig aaron think it ha to be you know this is just yet another example of why we can trust at and it promise and you know think it very concerning that at is literally you know putting employee right alongside sitting law enforcement to willingly mine their data to help them out and then sell it so they re taking their own customer private information selling it back to the government for hefty profit while violating their privacy so this is the kind of company at is you know eff ha exposed for year and year and year through their legal work everything at ha been up to supporting the dea the nsa etc think this is something to be concerned about when company get even bigger and when company is about to take over major news network who going to hold at accountable when these kind of story are out there are we going to even hear about them amy goodman we want to thank you both for being with u craig aaron president and ceo of free press and adam schwartz of the electronic frontier foundation of course we ll continue to follow this the decision is not finally made in fact craig aaron just what the timetable on this craig aaron think this merger we re probably talking about year which mean this is decision that going to be made by the next presidential administration by the justice department which give u time to organize but it very very important that we get started now because this is going to be fight that will be going well into next year amy goodman well thanks so much to both of you this is democracy now when we come back we head to north dakota to the standoff at standing rock well over hundred people were once again arrested yesterday a native american and their ally faced off against heavy heavily

              " 'herndon va stung by the recent supreme court decision that overturned texas abortion clinic restriction leader of the country largest group are redoubling their effort for restriction on abortion that they claim will prevent fetal pain and that they believe can fare well in the public eye and they hope in the court the group leader said they remained confident in their strategy of undermining roe wade one step at time with their main focus le on rule for clinic safety of the kind that were just overturned and more on what they call the humanity of the unborn child based on assumption about fetal development that are sharply disputed by mainstream scientist our people have had setback before but they re going to keep on fighting carol tobias the president of the group the national right to life committee declared at the organization annual meeting that wa held here thursday through saturday combination of pep talk tactical training and sharing of legislative strategy the movement is optimistic and excited about the future m tobias told hundred of delegate from across the country in public meeting at least the supreme court decision which wa described by many legal expert a landmark victory for abortion right received only passing mention here state have passed more than 300 measure since 2011 from mandatory ultrasound to rule for burial of fetal remains while the supreme court ruling could change the term it is already clear that pitched battle over abortion will continue in many state in the year ahead but amid continued flurry of bill national right to life and it affiliate will give the highest priority to two measure in particular the leader here said one is to promote state and federal ban on abortion at 20 week after conception based on the claim which mainstream medical scientist say is unfounded that the fetus can feel pain at that point the second is to outlaw the most common method of abortion form of dilation and evacuation on the ground that it is brutal and cruel the supreme court decision on june 27 ruling that stringent clinic and physician regulation in texas were unconstitutional is widely seen a the most important abortion ruling in decade the texas regulation required doctor to have admitting privilege at local hospital and required clinic to meet the physical and staffing requirement of surgery center measure the state argued that protected woman health but the court ruled that the state had failed to show significant benefit for woman health and safety and placed such onerous burden on clinic that many would have to shut down and so the court held in decision that the state had placed an illegal undue burden on woman basic right to abortion up to the point that the fetus is viable outside the womb the ruling whole woman health hellerstedt ha already led court to block similar clinic and physician rule in other state and is expected to figure in lawsuit over other restriction like ban on remote prescribing of pill for abortion or waiting period that cause hardship for poor woman who must travel to reach clinic but how broadly the ruling will apply to abortion law that do not involve claim about clinic safety or woman health will emerge from lower court decision over period of year legal expert say jennifer dalven the director of the reproductive freedom project at the american civil liberty union predicted in an interview that the decision will have effect on any abortion restriction that are based on scientifically dubious claim whether related to clinic safety or not the court wa crystal clear that politician can no longer rely on flimsy justification for abortion restriction she said you have to have evidence that it serf claimed interest then weigh it against the burden that ha application to virtually any regulation but leader are hoping and predicting that the effect will be more narrow they believe that the supreme court and particularly justice anthony kennedy who ha provided the swing vote in past case may look more favorably on law that focus on the life of the fetus the supreme court case wa focused on the health of the mother but we take different approach said mary spaulding balch the director of state legislation for national right to life noting that clinic safety regulation had mainly been promoted by other group our legislation focus on the humanity of the unborn child olivia gans turner the executive director of the virginia affiliate of national right to life said that the supreme court decision if anything really did energize large part of our constituency our people were anxious to find out can we still move ahead she said it wa chance to educate people she said adding that other priority law such a the proposed ban should not be affected promoted by national right to life and other group ban based on the fetal pain theory have been adopted by 15 state and are under consideration in several more it wa telling m balch said that when abortion right group challenged the texas clinic law they did not include the state ban which wa adopted at the same time and remains in effect legal expert for abortion right say that the law are clear violation of existing supreme court ruling that woman have right to an abortion until the fetus is viable outside the womb which is often about 22 week after conception they say they are waiting for the right occasion to bring court challenge to these ban which affect relatively few woman and that fending off the regulation that closed down clinic wa higher priority but m balch said group welcomed the chance to test the ban before the supreme court possibly leading it to change the existing dividing line for abortion right based on fetal viability in more recent push six state have acted to ban the most common method used in abortion in which the fetus is torn and extracted with tool in two of those state oklahoma and kansa the court have temporarily blocked the ban which many doctor have called an intrusion into medical decision that could expose woman to unneeded or more dangerous procedure a disappointed a they were by last month supreme court decision group are far more concerned about the november election for the senate and the presidency and the effect on the future makeup of the court while donald trump ha in the past expressed support for abortion right the leader here said they took at face value his statement that he had converted to their cause and would appoint conservative to the supreme court victory by hillary clinton and the appointment of one or more justice who share her strong support for abortion right would be catastrophic for the movement said anthony lauinger the chairman of oklahoman for life and vice president of national right to life creating very grim situation but whatever happens mr lauinger said we view the glass a half full mr lauinger 72 who ha been an activist since the roe wade decision in 1973 said

musician from the air force band it wa late winter night in 1966 and fully loaded bomber on cold war nuclear patrol had collided with refueling jet high over the spanish coast freeing four hydrogen bomb that went tumbling toward farming village called palomares patchwork of small field and white house in an corner of spain rugged southern coast that had changed little since roman time it wa one of the biggest nuclear accident in history and the united state wanted it cleaned up quickly and quietly but if the men getting onto bus were told anything about the air force plan for them to clean up spilled radioactive material it wa usually don worry there wa no talk about radiation or plutonium or anything else said frank thompson then trombone player who spent day searching contaminated field without protective equipment or even change of clothes they told u it wa safe and we were dumb enough guess to believe them mr thompson 72 now ha cancer in his liver lung and kidney he pay 2 200 month for treatment that would be free at veteran affair hospital if the air force recognized him a victim of radiation but for 50 year the air force ha maintained that there wa no harmful radiation at the crash site it say the danger of contamination wa minimal and strict safety measure ensured that all of the 1 600 troop who cleaned it up were protected interview with dozen of men like mr thompson and detail from never before published declassified document tell different story radiation near the bomb wa so high it sent the military monitoring equipment off the scale troop spent month shoveling toxic dust wearing little more protection than cotton fatigue and when test taken during the cleanup suggested men had alarmingly high plutonium contamination the air force threw out the result calling them clearly unrealistic in the decade since the air force ha purposefully kept radiation test result out of the men medical file and resisted call to retest them even when the call came from one of the air force own study many men say they are suffering with the crippling effect of plutonium poisoning of 40 veteran who helped with the cleanup who the new york time identified 21 had cancer nine had died from it it is impossible to connect individual cancer to single exposure to radiation and no formal mortality study ha ever been done to determine whether there is an elevated incidence of disease the only evidence the men have to rely on are anecdote of friend they watched wither away john young dead of cancer dudley easton cancer furmanksi cancer said larry slone 76 in an interview laboring through tremor caused by neurological disorder at the crash site mr slone military police officer at the time said he wa given plastic bag and told to pick up radioactive fragment with his bare hand couple time they checked me with geiger counter and it went clear off the scale he said but they never took my name never followed up with me monitoring of the village in spain ha also been haphazard declassified document show the united state promised to pay for public health program to monitor the effect of radiation there but for decade provided little funding until the 1980s spanish scientist often relied on broken and outdated equipment and lacked the resource to follow up on potential ramification including leukemia death in child today several area are still contaminated and the health effect on villager is poorly understood many of the american who cleaned up after the bomb are trying to get full health care coverage and disability compensation from the department of veteran affair but the department relies on air force record and since the air force record say no one wa harmed in palomares the agency reject claim again and again the air force also denies any harm wa done to 500 other veteran who cleaned up nearly identical crash in thule greenland in 1968 those veteran tried to sue the defense department in 1995 but the case wa dismissed because federal law shield the military from negligence claim by troop all of the named plaintiff have since died of cancer in statement the air force medical service said it had recently used modern technique to reassess the radiation risk to veteran who cleaned up the palomares accident and adverse acute health effect were neither expected nor observed and risk for increased incidence of cancer to the bone liver and lung were low the toxic aftermath of war is often vexing to untangle damage is hard to quantify and all but impossible to connect to later problem recognizing this congress ha passed law in the past to give automatic benefit to veteran of few specific exposure agent orange in vietnam or the atomic test in nevada among others but no such law exists for the men who cleaned up palomares if the men could prove they were harmed by radiation they would have all cost for their associated medical care covered and would get modest disability pension but proof from secret mission to clean up an invisible poison decade ago ha proved elusive so each time the men apply the air force say they were not harmed and the department hand out denial first they denied wa even there then they denied there wa any radiation said ronald howell 71 who recently had brain tumor removed submit claim and they deny submit appeal and they deny now m all out of appeal he sighed then continued pretty soon we ll all be dead and they will have succeeded at covering this whole thing up military police officer named john garman arrived by helicopter at the crash site on jan 17 1966 few hour after the bomb blew it wa just chaos mr garman now 74 said in an interview at his home in pahrump nev wreckage wa all over the village big part of the bomber had crashed down in the yard of the school he wa one of the first on the scene and joined others to hunt for the four missing nuclear weapon one bomb had thudded into soft sandbank near the beach and crumpled but remained intact another had dropped into the ocean where it wa found unbroken two month later after frenzied hunt the other two hit hard and exploded leaving crater on either side of the village according to secret atomic energy commission report that ha since been declassified safeguard prevented nuclear detonation but explosive surrounding the radioactive core blasted fine dust of plutonium over patchwork of house and field full of ripe red tomato throng of resident led mr garman to the crater where they peered down at the shattered wreckage not knowing what to do we didn have any radiation detector yet so we had no idea if we were in danger he said we just stood there looking down at the hole atomic energy commission scientist soon arrived and took mr garman clothes because they were contaminated he said but told him he would be fine twelve year later he got bladder cancer plutonium doe not emit the type of penetrating radiation often associated with nuclear blast which cause immediately obvious health effect such a burn it shoot off alpha particle that travel only few inch and cannot penetrate the skin outside the body scientist say it is relatively harmless but speck absorbed in the body usually through inhaling dust shoot off continuous shower of radioactive particle thousand of time minute gradually exacting damage that can cause cancer and other disease decade later microgram or millionth of gram in the body is considered potentially harmful according to declassified atomic energy commission report the bomb at palomares released an estimated seven pound more than 3 billion microgram the day after the crash busload of troop started arriving from united state base bringing equipment william jackson young air force lieutenant helped with some of the first testing near the crater using alpha particle counter that could measure up to two million alpha particle per minute almost everywhere we pointed the machine it pegged at the highest reading he said but we were told that type of radiation would not penetrate the skin we were told it wa safe the pentagon focused on finding the bomb lost in the ocean and largely ignored the danger of loose plutonium the air force personnel at the site said troop traipsed needlessly through highly contaminated tomato field with no safety gear many came to gawk at the shattered bomb in the first few day once went to check on the i and found them dangling their leg into the crater mr jackson said just sitting there eating their box lunch account of the crash became news in europe and the united state american and spanish official immediately tried to cover up the accident and play down the risk they blocked off the village and denied nuclear weapon or radiation were involved in the crash when an american reporter spotted men wearing white coverall military press officer told him oh they re member of the postal detachment once existence of the bomb leaked more than month later the united state admitted that one bomb not two had cracked but had released only small amount of basically harmless radiation today the two exploded warhead would be known a dirty bomb and would probably cause evacuation at the time in order to minimize the significance of the blast the air force let villager remain in place official invited the news medium to witness spain minister of information manuel fraga iribarne and united state ambassador angier biddle duke splashing on nearby beach to show the area wa safe mr duke told reporter if this is radioactivity love it fearing that the bomb could damage the tourism industry spain insisted the mess be cleaned up before summer within day troop were hacking down contaminated field of tomato vine with machete though scientist overseeing the cleanup knew plutonium dust posed the greatest danger military commander had the troop throw thousand of truckloads of vine into chipping machine then burned much of the debris near the village some men doing the dustiest work were given coverall and paper surgical mask for safety but later report by the defense nuclear agency said it is doubtful that the use of the surgical mask served more than psychological barrier if it did something for your psychology to wear one you were privileged to wear one the chief scientific adviser dr wright langham told atomic energy colleague in secret briefing afterward it wouldn do you any good in the way of protection but if you felt better we let you wear it commenting on safety at the cleanup dr langham who is perhaps best known now for his role in secret experiment in which hospital patient in the united state were unwittingly injected with plutonium told colleague most of the time it would hardly meet the standard of the health physic manual the air force bought ton of contaminated tomato from local field that the spanish public refused to eat to assure the public there wa no danger commander fed the tomato to the troop though the risk from eating plutonium is much lower than the risk from inhaling it it is still not safe breakfast lunch and dinner we had them until we were sick of them said wayne hugart 74 who wa military police officer at the site they kept saying there wa nothing wrong with them in all the air force cut down 600 acre of crop and plowed under the contaminated dirt troop scooped up 5 300 barrel of soil from the most radioactive area near the crater and loaded the barrel on ship to be buried in secure nuclear waste storage site in south carolina spanish and american authority assured villager that they had nothing to fear the villager accustomed to living in dictatorship did little to protest even if some people here might have wanted to know more franco wa in charge so everybody wa too scared to ask anything said antonio latorre villager who is now 78 to assure villager their home were safe the air force sent young airman into local house with radiation detector peter ricard then cook with no training on the equipment remembers being told to perform scan of anything local wanted but to keep his detector turned off we were just supposed to feign our reading so we didn cause turmoil with the native he said in an interview often think about that now wasn too smart back then they say do it and you just say yes sir during the cleanup medical team gathered more than 1 500 urine sample from the cleanup crew to calculate how much plutonium they were absorbing the higher the level in the sample the greater the health hazard the record of those test remain perhaps the most prominent artifact from the cleanup they show about only 10 of the men absorbed more than the allowed safe dose and the rest of the 1 500 responder were not harmed the air force today relies on the result to argue that the men were never harmed by radiation but the men who actually did the testing say the result are deeply flawed and are of little use in determining who wa exposed did we follow protocol hell no we had neither the time nor the equipment said victor skaar now 79 who worked on the testing team the formula for determining the contamination level required collecting urine for 12 hour but he said he wa able to get only single sample from many men and others he said were never tested at all he sent sample to the air force chief of radiation testing dr lawrence odland who started seeing alarmingly high result dr odland decided the extreme level did not indicate true health threat but were caused by plutonium loose in the camp that contaminated the men hand their clothes and everything else he threw out about 1 000 sample 67 percent of the result including all sample from the first day after the blast when exposure wa probably highest now 94 and living in rambling victorian house in hillsboro ohio where photo from the greenland crash hang in his hall dr odland questioned his decision we had no way of knowing what wa from contamination and what wa from inhalation he said wa the world ending or wa everything fine just had to make call he said he never got accurate result for hundred of men who may have been contaminated in addition he soon realized plutonium lodged in the lung could not always be detected in veteran urine and men with clean sample might still be contaminated it sad sure it sad he said but what can you do you can take the plutonium out you can cure the cancer all you can do is bow your head and say you are sorry convinced that the urine sample were inadequate dr odland persuaded the air force in 1966 to set up permanent plutonium deposition registry board to monitor the men for life expert from the air force army navy veteran administration now the department of veteran affair and atomic energy commission met to establish the program shortly after the cleanup in welcoming remark the air force general in charge said the program wa essential and following the men to their graf would provide urgently needed data the organizer proposed not notifying troop of their radiation exposure and keeping detail of testing out of medical record according to minute of the meeting out of concern notifying them could set stage for legal action the plan wa to have dr odland staff follow the men within month though he had hit wall he is not able to get the support from the department of defense to go after the remaining people or set up real registry because of the policy an atomic energy commission memo from 1967 noted the sleeping dog policy it wa to leave it alone let it lie didn agree hell no didn agree dr odland said everyone decided we should watch these guy take care of them and then from somewhere up high they decided it wa better to get rid of it dr odland did not know who gave the order to terminate the program but said since the board included all the military branch and the veteran agency it likely came from official the air force officially dismantled the program in 1968 the permanent board had met just once troop started to get sick soon after the cleanup ended healthy men in their 20 were crippled by joint pain headache and weakness doctor said it wa arthritis young military policeman wa plagued by sinus swelling so acute that he would bang his head on the floor to distract himself from the pain doctor said it wa allergy several men got rash or growth an airman named noris paul had cyst severe enough that he spent six month in the hospital in 1967 getting skin graft he also became infertile no one knew what wa wrong with me mr paul said grocery supply clerk named arthur kindler who had been so covered in plutonium while searching the tomato field few day after the blast that the air force made him wash off in the ocean and took his clothes got testicular cancer and rare lung infection that nearly killed him four year after the crash in the year since he ha had cancer of his lymph node three time it took me long time to start to realize this maybe had to do with cleaning up the bomb mr kindler 74 said in an interview from his home in tucson you have to understand they told u everything wa safe we were young we trusted them why would they lie mr kindler filed twice for help from the department of veteran affair they always denied me he said eventually just gave up the united state promised to pay for monitoring of health in the village but for decade it provided only about 15 percent of funding with spain paying the rest according to declassified department of energy summary broken station went unfixed and equipment wa often old and unreliable in the early 1970s an atomic energy commission scientist noted the spanish field monitoring team consisted of lone graduate student report of two child dying of leukemia during that time went uninvestigated the lead spanish scientist monitoring the population told american counterpart in 1976 memo that in light of the leukemia case palomares needed some kind of medical surveillance of the population to keep watch for disease or death none wa created in the late 1990s after year of pressure from spain the united state agreed to increase funding new survey of the village found extensive contamination that had gone undetected including some area where radiation wa 20 time the permissible level for inhabited area in 2004 spain quietly fenced off the most contaminated land near the bomb crater since then spain ha urged the united state to finish cleaning the site because of the uneven monitoring the effect on public health is far from clear small mortality study in 2005 found cancer rate had gone up in the village compared with similar village in the region but the author pedro antonio martínez pinilla an epidemiologist cautioned that the result could be because of random error and urged more study at that time united state department of energy scientist terry hamilton proposed another study noting problem in spain monitoring technique it wa clear the uptake of plutonium wa poorly understood he said in an interview the department did not approve his proposal spanish official say the fear may be overblown yolanda benito who head the environmental department of ciemat spain nuclear agency said that medical check showed no uptick in cancer in palomares from scientific point of view there is nothing that allows u to draw relationship between the case of cancer in the local population and the accident she said about fifth of the plutonium spread in 1966 is estimated to still contaminate the area after year of pressure the united state agreed in 2015 to clean up the remaining plutonium but there is no approved plan or timetable on recent rainy morning nona watson retired science teacher in buckhead ga held open the door of veteran medical center in atlanta for her husband nolan watson who hobbled in his shuddering hand unable to steady his cane a dog handler mr watson slept in the dirt just foot from one of the bomb crater the day after the blast year later he wa racked by blinding headache and hip so stiff he could barely walk at the time he asked the department of veteran affair for help he said he wa turned away for year he had problem with painful joint kidney stone and localized skin cancer in 2002 he wa diagnosed with kidney cancer and one of his kidney wa removed in 2010 more cancer showed up in his remaining kidney recent abnormal blood test suggested leukemia think it ruined my life he said wa young in good shape but since that day ve had problem all the time mr watson now 73 had filed claim with the veteran agency that wa denied and he wa in the process of appealing other veteran of palomares had warned him that it wa waste of time only one palomares veteran they knew of had succeeded in claiming harm from radiation and it took 10 year at which point he wa bedridden with stomach cancer but mr watson wanted to come to the medical center to give personal testimony about his plutonium exposure in the center waiting room his nose began to bleed few year ago after his first claim wa denied mr watson wife began hunting down old government document hoping she might find something to prove the air force wa covering up palomares maybe she thought she could discover evidence that would make the authority reconsider she turned up report going back 40 year that confirmed the men story of high radiation level and poor safety standard but her most striking find wa an air force study from 2001 that reassessed the contamination in palomares veteran the study determined that the old urine test were so flawed that they were not useful and the air force should retest the men mr watson knew no retesting had been done so she called the air force medical service to ask why when she could not get clear answer she asked her congressman at the time paul broun republican of georgia to send letter to the air force when the congressman could not get clear answer either he proposed legislation which the house passed in 2013 requiring the air force to answer to congress in 2013 the air force provided it legally required response in letter to the house armed service committee to mr watson dismay it echoed what she and the congressman had already been told new testing recommended in the 2001 report wa not necessary because troop had worn protective equipment and the original urine test showed that almost no one had been exposed to radiation declassified document and witness account raise serious question about the accuracy of the air force report to congress after issuing the letter the air force medical service quietly took down from it website the only public copy of the 2001 report had gone into this thinking it wa just an old mistake but then found they were still trying to cover it up mr watson said in an interview at her home col kirk phillips who oversees the radiation health program for the air force medical service said in recent interview that the air force ha tried it best to do right by the palomares veteran it took down the report because it did not want to raise the hope of veteran and feared reader would find it confusing we have large number of veteran we believe were not exposed he said radiation level at palomares were low he said and men wore safety equipment retesting them with more precise modern technique a the 2001 report suggested could reveal even lower contamination level making it even le likely that the veteran would get compensation from the department we think retesting could be real mistake he said it could harm our veteran because we think it would find even lower level of radiation in the interest of giving palomares veteran what he called the benefit of the doubt he said the air force stopped relying in 2013 on the old urine test result and instead assigned all troop who cleaned up the site scenario dose based on ambient air reading of radiation from the time it gave them dose of 0 31 rem very small dose too low to qualify veteran for department benefit the greenland veteran who cleaned up similar crash have been assigned dose of zero mr watson who ha studied palomares test result and report in detail said the ambient air test probably do not reflect what individual working near the crater absorbed a far a can tell it not based on anything and won do anyone any good she said you wonder why they even bothered a she waited at the medical center with her husband she explained how they expected their appeal to fail they had no proof no matter what he said in his testimony the department would refer to old urine sample to determine who wa harmed and mr watson had never given urine sample he could not offer new urine sample because cancer had taken most of his kidney if successful with the appeal mr watson would have all of his medical cost covered and get modest monthly disability payment but that not why m doing it he said a he dabbed at his nose m not about the money he doubted he would live long enough to collect much more than anything he wanted the record straight he wanted to tell the air force that he and the men he served with mattered enough to be told the truth m going to speak my piece dang it mr watson said they know this whole thing is lie',\n",

              " 'a few week after the election of donald trump pundit with their eye glued to twitter believed they finally deciphered the master plan behind the tweeting every time he detonated bomb on twitter they suspected it wa sly bid to divert the public eye from more serious news about his impending administration so when mr trump reignited the dormant debate over flag burning one morning tweeting that those who set fire to the flag should suffer loss of citizenship or year in jail new york magazine jonathan chait quickly produced column decoding the message he called it strange fight and classic nationalist distraction that prof mr trump dangerous and authoritarian politics is calculated and not merely crazy but soon competing theory emerged minute before mr trump tweet fox friend one of the favorite show ran segment referencing an american flag burned on college campus to protest his victory he wasn carrying out some strategy he wa his tv twitter is an impulsive medium log in and you re greeted immediately with text box asking what happening a in right this second mr trump who is set to become the nation 45th president on friday is master of twitter but also in it thrall theory of some grand trump twitter plot forget that impetuous and aggressive tweeting ha been habit of mr trump for year he famously avoids alcohol twitter is his vice and after eight year of post from barackobama equally journalist are transfixed by mr trump timeline too mr trump ha always been hooked on recognition he is obsessed with his television rating his office is festooned with magazine cover featuring himself even negative attention can be win he thrilled to be named time person of the year even if the cover might evoke image of both hitler and satan but today magazine cover and tv hit lack the cultural dominance they once held a mr trump tweeted in 2013 time look really flimsy like free handout at parking lot now he found medium where recognition arrives every fraction of second and his reach is quantified in real time rating but for every sentence you ever write scroll through the list of account mr trump follows and you ll find tightly curated crew of trump relative like ivanka property trump waikiki celebrity rom downey wife to the apprentice producer mark burnett and reliably outlet fox friend naturally it a remarkable picture of social medium restraint for twitter most uninhibited star and it give glimpse at the image mr trump intends to project devoted family man tremendous business magnate friend to gary player but mr trump dominant posture is reactive and his real focus is on who follows him he almost exclusively retweets praise from fan he tweet about all the credit he deserves thank you so many people have given me credit for winning the debate last night then wait for more virtual credit to roll in he brag to journalist about the rate at which like and retweets hit he get high on his own supply part of the peculiarity of mr trump tweet is that he tweet like celebrity not politician or businessman even his handle realdonaldtrump suggests his full immersion in the most basic of our celebrity culture though he preparing to assume the presidency he tweet like hollywood social climber he fan celebrity feud with graydon carter no talent and meryl streep and post product endorsement buy l bean the highest office in the land ha afforded mr trump his most prominent celebrity perch his account ha risen from few million follower to nearly 20 million in the past year there wa time when some assumed that mr trump public persona would evolve a he rose in the political rank but there just one trump and that been key to his success a kim kardashian once said the secret to social medium dominance is authenticity and consistency mr trump projection of realness relies on him being reliably and wildly inappropriate that may seem like liability for the leader of the free world but it an asset in the celebrity role that have led him to this moment reality tv bos howard stern guest heel eight year ago barack obama wa the social medium wonder headed to the white house and his tech savvy wa heralded a bright light for democracy the tweet he post to potus never seem impulsive they seem made for posterity even his joke are calculated to be minimally offensive and maximally educational when the nasa rover curiosity carried mr obama signature to the surface of mar mr obama responded in the form of dad joke that is out of this world if mr obama came to power in time of great optimism for twitter mr trump lord over waning platform what wa once hopeful place for global connection and resistance ha become site for coordinating harassment campaign connecting with white supremacist and accelerating unverified and sometimes dangerous rumor it growth ha slumped and it stock price ha stagnated but the place suit mr trump purpose fine for the guy who all about appearance twitter provides the veneer of populist connection without the hassle of accountability sean spicer mr trump incoming press secretary ha suggested that twitter town hall and reddit forum may replace some typical presidential press interaction where he can easily make himself available to anonymous fan instead of the scrutiny of the press the social medium platform that were once heralded a democratic tool could also be used to undermine democratic norm all of this work because one group is a intoxicated by twitter a mr trump is journalist it hard to explain to normal person one of the 79 percent of american adult who don use twitter why the platform mesmerizes the news medium it search function mean you can conjure material on any kind of news topic or just spend your time searching for your own name reporter still crave the ego rush of published byline but that pale in comparison to the animated feedback loop that twitter offer the more time you spend and the more tweet you send the bigger your following becomes but twitter provides little actual reach compared with facebook or google it hardly drive any traffic to article it like video game for professional validation mr trump expertly exploit journalist unwavering attention to their twitter feed their competitive spirit and their ingrained journalistic convention chiefly that what the president say is inherently newsworthy a developer and reality show star he lobbied the news medium for coverage now journalist feel obligated to pay attention to him mr trump overwhelms the medium with boatload of what wa once rare commodity access he creates impression faster than journalist can check them by the time they turn up the fact the news cycle ha moved on to his next missive leaving le time and reader attention for the story mr trump doe not highlight on his feed mr trump may not follow deliberate distraction strategy but he doesn need one he distracts instinctively all he need is phone the press and whatever thought just entered

stockpile of gold a well a russia native currency the ruble take look at the symbol below a it could soon come to change the entire hierarchy of the international order potentially ushering in complete international paradigm shift and much sooner than you might think the symbol is the new designation of the russian ruble russia national currency similar to how the s us the dollar sign the k us the pound sign and the european union us the euro symbol russia is about to begin exporting it symbol internationally after the failed reset in s russian relation by the obama administration and the continued deterioration of the country relationship washington began targeting entire sector of the russian economy a well a specific individual meant to impose an economic burden so severe that it would force moscow into compliance instead of decimating russia what it precipitated wa russian response of gradually weaning themselves off of the hegemony of the s petrodollar and working with china to create an alternative to the swift payment system that isn solely controlled by western interest see asian infrastructure investment bank new development bank according to the corbett report new report indicate that china is ready to launch it swift alternative and for those who have their ear to the ground this is the most significant move yet in the unfolding process of de dollarization that is seeing the brics led resistance bloc breaking away from the financial stranglehold of the u led washington consensus for those who don know swift stand for the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication and is shorthand for the swiftnet network that is used by over 10 500 financial institution in 215 country and territory to transmit financial transaction data around the world swift doe not do any of the clearing or processing for these transaction itself but instead sends the payment order that are then settled by correspondent bank of the member institution still given the system near universality in the financial system it mean that virtually every international transaction between banking institution go through the swift network this is why de listing from the swift network remains one of the primary financial weapon wielded by the u and it ally in their increasingly important financial warfare campaign recently financial guru jim rickards author of the book currency war wrote that russia is poised for major comeback in it economy russian bond and stock and the russian currency the ruble will all benefit rickards belief strong turnaround is coming within russia and that this comeback will benefit the ruble while still suffering from the economic warfare being waged by the s russia ha realized that a long they are subservient to the petrodollar there remains clear and present danger of the russian economy being devastated by the whim of washington the bank of russia that nation central bank is extremely clear about it mission and monetary policy declaring on it website monetary policy constitutes an integral part of the state policy and is aimed at enhancing well being of russian citizen the bank of russia implement monetary policy in the framework of inflation targeting regime and see price stability albeit sustainably low inflation a it priority given structural peculiarity of the russian economy the target is to reduce inflation to 4 by 2017 and maintain it within that range in the medium run in layman term that mean that monetary policy similar to nuclear weapon and the military are an integral part of the state policy in russia while many analyst have noted the increased build up in russia military arsenal seemingly few have highlighted the massive build up of russian gold reserve over the past decade below is chart showing russian gold reserve between 1994 and last year 2015 since 2006 there ha been year on year increase that reveals significant upward trend the chart clearly reveals that russia state policy of increasing state monetary asset in the form of gold additionally the russian government ha been converting state ruble into gold asset from 2006 to 2015 russia state holding of gold tripled within just the past year russia ha substantially increased it gold holding according to the business insider in july of this year the central bank of russia added 200 000 ounce of gold to it reserve the one month uptick in russian gold reserve 200 000 ounce is approximately equal to the entire annual output of barrick gold turquoise ridge gold mine in nevada at that same rate 200 000 ounce per month in mere five month russia would add to state gold reserve the equivalent of the entire annual output of barrick massive goldstrike mine in nevada currently russian gold reserve rank seventh in the world it clear that there is concerted effort by russian authority to build up the country gold reserve a part of national strategy to negate the effect of economic warfare waged by the united state rickards in his 2011 book currency war theorized that russia and china could combine their gold reserve to form global gold backed currency to compete against the s dollar currently russian reserve stand at roughly 1 500 tonne with chinese reserve totaling over 1 800 tonne according to china it likely more which would amount to combined total of roughly 3 300 tonne of gold the s is about to lose overarching control of policymaking within the international monetary fund imf thus the s lockup on global gold is about to vanish according to business insider imagine for moment the distinctly real possibility that russian chinese alliance could exercise indirect or even direct control over the imf gold reserve of over 2 800 tonne russian chinese and imf gold combined would equal roughly 6 100 tonne and would allow for direct competition with the s gold reserve estimated at 8 100 tonne russia and china have realized that the petrodollar is wielded by washington a it weapon of choice when opposing well armed state and clearly see the writing on the wall thus working together to create new global financial paradigm the reality is that the united state is 20 trillion dollar in debt and eventually the time will come when the s economy begin to implode and all the fiat currency people are stuck holding will essentially be worth nothing more than the paper it printed on hard asset such a gold and silver should be bought and taken custody of while there is still an opportunity to do so a mean of hedging against the potentially disastrous result of the s using the petrodollar a weapon it not russian nuclear weapon that people should fear a the policy of mutually assured destruction essentially void any benefit of state launching first strike nuclear attack the true threat to

troubling enough that they left 21st century fox little choice but to force an end to mr ailes reign a chairman and chief executive of fox news given the potential liability they presented to the company both legally and in term of it own corporate culture the people with knowledge of the state of discussion over mr ailes exit agreement said both side were working toward an accommodation that would recognize mr ailes service to the company a the founder and leader of fox news which sits atop the cable news rating and is major profit engine for 21st century fox the agreement could also include provision for him to continue with fox a consultant but given the personality and complication involved the situation wa fluid enough that no accommodation had been reached by wednesday night fox news did not respond to request for comment on the status of the discussion or on the investigation which is being conducted by the law firm paul wei rifkind wharton garrison lawyer for mr ailes did not respond to request for comment mr ailes ha denied the allegation of sexual harassment and more than dozen fox news staff member including some top star have publicly supported him the people briefed on the investigation who would not speak for attribution because of the sensitivity of the investigation stressed that it wa narrowly focused on the allegation against mr ailes and not the broader climate at the network but mr ailes departure will have much wider implication given fox news place a central hub for conservative opinion not to mention a primary outlet for the republican

gretchen carlson former fox anchor filed suit against mr ailes the murdoch family which run 21st century fox ha made it clear that it decision to take the allegation seriously wa in keeping with it desire to follow modern standard for office conduct and that these needed to extend to fox news a well the question in the environment is to what extent the murdoch decide to continue on with mr ailes current management team that in turn could determine the future approach and look of the network which is the outlet of choice for viewer seeking an alternative to the mainstream medium speculation about who mr ailes successor would be transfixed the medium world on wednesday with focus on outsider such a the cbs news president david rhodes who had worked at fox news for several year one of mr ailes current lieutenant like bill shine or michael clemente the new york post chief executive jesse angelo or someone from conservative medium like christopher ruddy the founder and chief executive

investigator that mr ailes had acted improperly with her one of the people briefed on the inquiry said tuesday m kelly maintained her silence on wednesday but a the end of mr ailes chairmanship

news employee said inappropriate comment about woman appearance and her sex life were frequent in the newsroom the newsroom ha been on edge in the week since m carlson filed her suit one person said everybody want to talk about the drama but nobody want to talk in the open the person said a of wednesday evening staff member had not received an email from 21st century fox fox news or mr ailes informing them about the event that have transpired the investigation or the future of the network the swift pace of event at fox news only two week passed between m carlson filing of her lawsuit and

mr ailes and the 21st century fox patriarch rupert murdoch female host in skirt sitting behind translucent desk that can highlight their leg have always been network trademark to completely move away from that ethos would be to fundamentally change the network and 21st century fox leadership will have to be mindful of maintaining it special relationship with viewer that mr ailes ha so carefully

is euphemistically called fund raising many hundred of million of dollar were provided for the party over the last couple of decade by bill clinton effort hillary clinton fully appreciated the fact that money buy power and influence she lacked bill superficial charm but she certainly more than shared his ambition on the charm front when she wa ready to move into running for office she adopted perhaps under bill tutelage kind of forced set of expression with arched eyebrow bugged out eye and smile a big a her lip would allow these expression were accompanied by little gesture such a briefly

democratic party is in serious trouble too it ha great deal of internal rot a the wikileaks material from the democratic national committee clearly show u arrogance lack of direction ignorance of the people whom the party ha always claimed to serve bad decision making and the absolute prostrate worship of money are the major symptom sen bernie sander and former secretary of state hillary clinton at democratic presidential debate sponsored by cnn it would have been impossible for the party to have so made up it mind and committed it resource to hillary clinton without serious rot she ha always had strong negative in polling always been rightly suspected concerning her honesty the wikileaks material tell u about many internal conflict including harsh high level judgment of hillary decision making resentment over the backstabbing character of daughter chelsea who is said to resemble hillary in her behavior and attitude and the belief of some that hillary just should not have run and frankly hillary clinton had become for many rather tiresome used up figure from whom absolutely nothing spectacular in politics or policy could possibly be expected but they not only blindly supported her they broke all their own party rule by internally and secretly working to defeat legitimate and viable contender bernie sander sander might well have been able to win the election for the democrat but their establishment wa blind to the possibility and rejected his candidacy out of hand after all there were bill and hillary beckoning toward their running well of money in hindsight it might be just a well that sander wa cheated out of the nomination he proved weak individual in the end giving in to just the force that he had claimed to oppose and leaving his enthusiastic follower completely let down there he wa out on the hustings supporting everything he ever opposed a personified in hillary clinton men of that nature do not stand up well to general and admiral and the head of massive corporation quality which do think we have some right to expect trump to display public distrust another important fact about the election is that it wa le the triumph of trump than the avoidance of hillary that caused the defeat the number are unmistakable yes trump did well for political newcomer and very controversial figure but hillary simply did badly not approaching the support obama achieved in key state again something reflecting the documented fact that she is not well liked figure and the party blundered badly in running her president elect donald trump but again money talk and the clinton particularly bill are the biggest fundraiser they have had in our lifetime no one wa ready to say no to the source of all that money now to many american the election result must seem bit like having experienced something of revolution although revolution conducted through ballot any other kind being literally impossible by design in this massive military security state in way it doe represent something of revolutionary event owing to the fact that trump the oligarch is in his political view bit of revolutionary or at least dissenter from the prevailing establishment view and a in any revolution even small one there are going to be some unpleasant outcome the historical truth of politics is that you never know from just what surprising source change may come lyndon johnson life long crooked politician and the main author of the horrifying and pointless vietnam war did more for the right of black american than any other modern president franklin roosevelt son of wealthy establishment figure provided remarkable leadership in the great depression restoring hope and dream for million change important change never come from establishment or institution like political party it always come from unusual people who seem to step out of their accustomed role in life with some good or inspired idea and have the drive and toughness to make them reality have some limited but important hope for trump am not blind or delirious expecting miracle from this unusual person and after the experience of barack obama who seemed such promising young figure but fairly quickly proved crushing bloody disappointment can never build up substantial hope for any politician and what wa the choice anyway hillary clinton wa bought and paid one way ticket to hell trump offer two area of some hope and these both represent real change the first is in reducing america close to out of control military aggressiveness abroad this aggressiveness reflecting momentum from what can only be called the cheney rumsfeld presidency continued and grew under the weak and ineffectual leadership of obama and wa boosted and encouraged by hillary a secretary of state hillary did lot of killing during her tenure inside the federal government advocating and promoting military intervention a first lady s senator and secretary of state she along with obama is responsible for the death of ten of thousand of men woman and child many of them literally torn apart by bomb welfare of american the other area of some hope is for the welfare of ordinary american who have been completely ignored by national leader for decade george bush lame reaction to hurricane katrina before he wa internationally shamed into some action ha become the normal pattern for america national government when it come to ordinary american president franklin delano roosevelt at press conference inside the democratic party the truth is that the legacy of fdr ha withered to nothing and no longer play any role and of course never did in the republican party by welfare do not mean the kind of state assistance to the poor that bill clinton himself worked to end nothing can impress someone not familiar with america dark corner more than visit to place like detroit or gary or chicago south side part of new orleans or newark or dozen of other place where american live in condition in every way comparable to third world hellhole no mean the people general well being trump approach will be through job and creating incentive for job don know whether he can succeed but just a he asked people in some of his speech what do you have to lose just having someone in power who pay any attention to the deplorables is small gain people should never think of the clinton a liberal or progressive and that wa just a much true for bill a it is for hillary his record a president apart from his embarrassing behavior in the oval office with young female intern and his recruitment of secret service guard a procurer for woman he found attractive on his morning run wa actually pretty appalling in his own word he ended welfare a we know it he signed legislation that would send large number of young black men to prison he also signed legislation that contributed to the country later financial collapse under george bush he often would appoint someone decent and then quickly back off leaving them dangling when it looked like approval for the appointment would not be coming his fbi conducted the assault on waco killing about 80 people needlessly pharmaceutical plant in sudan wa destroyed by cruise missile for no good reason there were number of scandal that were never fully explained to the public it wa his secretary of state madeleine albright who answered unblinkingly television interviewer question about half million iraqi child who died owing to america embargo we think the price is worth it he committed the war crime of bombing belgrade including the intentional destruction of the serb tv building when news of the horror of the rwanda genocide were first detected by his government the order secretly went out to shut up about it no effort wa made to intervene in that case no any real change in america could never come from people like the clinton either one of them john chuckman is former chief economist for large canadian oil company',\n",

unarmed black man shot dead disturbing confrontation captured on video that prompted outrage across the country but this time the officer firing the deadly shot wa woman rarity in fatal police encounter that is an anomaly said chuck wexler the executive director of the police executive research forum policy group one of thing we know from our work on developing training is that the skill that woman use in these situation primarily communication and engaging with the person are enormously effective in defusing potentially volatile encounter police officer kill about 1 000 people each year according to data collected by philip stinson an associate professor of criminal justice at bowling green state university in ohio who us figure from the justice department and the center for disease control and prevention only handful of those shooting are by female officer mr stinson analysis show that since 2005 there have been 77 police officer charged with manslaughter or murder for an shooting only three of those including officer shelby were woman the other two were not convicted beginning in the 1990s police department started recruiting woman more aggressively a they sought to minimize the use of excessive force there are now more than 100 000 female law enforcement officer in the nation member of group that ha risen to the highest rank in houston minneapolis seattle and other big city the reason female officer kill le often than their male colleague ha been the subject of only limited research and attributed to variety of factor most notable is that they are represented in only small percentage of police force about 15 percent of department nationwide according to bureau of justice statistic survey other explanation range from the relative dearth of woman who work some of the most dangerous police job such a gang detail to an explanation that is common though unproved that female officer are more diplomatic and le confrontational than their male counterpart but most current female officer interviewed said those stereotype did not play out in the field we have some men that are the first one we would put in with difficult people because they are such good communicator said jacqueline luthcke who is chief of the ridgewood j police department she and other female officer pointed to size a one of the only way that gender might alter their approach to the job they don have the physical edge in encounter with citizen so instead they defuse the situation from the beginning put more effort into trying to talk their way out of the situation than to try to resort to physical force said jane castor retired chief of the tampa police department but prosecutor accuse officer shelby 42 who ha been on the force for five year of acting more aggressively than the male officer around her officer shelby wa arrested booked and bonded out on friday morning at the county criminal justice center in court document officer shelby is accused of overreacting to mr crutcher refusal to follow her command and of fearing for her life although she saw no evidence that he wa armed officer shelby fear resulted in her unreasonable action and even though mr crutcher wa not responsive to her and wa walking away from her she became emotionally involved to the point that she overreacted prosecutor allege in court document although she wa armed with taser at the time she pulled out her firearm male officer who stood next to her used his taser on mr crutcher in video capturing the shooting officer shelby can be heard shouting shot fired her husband who is also tulsa police officer wa observing from police helicopter although it wa not clear whether he knew his wife had fired the fatal shot female officer say that civilian subject often react differently to them because of their gender and the mere presence of male officer can sometimes be enough to provoke someone expert say can remember countless incident where everything would be under control and male police officer would show up and all of sudden that tension and that testosterone not saying the male officer did anything inappropriate but it all it take said m castor who wa an officer for 31 year but chief kristen ziman of the aurora ill police said that being female officer can cut both way when it come to using force learned very quickly in my career that couldn rely on my physical strength to effect an arrest like my larger male counterpart she said instead learned to talk people into handcuff by using human influence and communication skill but she added some female of small stature may be quicker to use force because their opponent is larger and able to physically overtake them when penny harrington who went on to become the country first female police chief of major city joined the portland ore police department in 1964 woman had to wear plain clothes and carry their service weapon in their purse at that point female officer in portland were not allowed to do street patrol but a more woman joined the force in the 1970s many male officer argued that woman were emotionally unfit for the job and would be more likely to resort to lethal force because they were smaller and would be unable to overpower subject through other mean research on the subject ha ranged from being inconclusive to showing that the opposite is true that woman are le likely to use force even controlling for their relatively low representation among police force the handful of case in recent year included lisa mearkle of the hummelstown pa police who in february

washington also ha restricted some flight from kuwait morocco qatar and the united arab emirate london meanwhile ha additionally restricted flight from some airport in lebanon and tunisia the

turkish airline egyptair and royal jordanian among others and it affect direct flight to the united kingdom from turkey lebanon jordan egypt tunisia and saudi arabia british official said the k ban

touchdown on his first drive and eventually beating the brown this is who he is eagle coach doug pederson said after the game this is his dna he prepared like veteran and he played that way his maturity level wa outstanding the brown who have seemed cursed at the quarterback position since bernie kosar wa released in 1991 knew that keeping the no 2 pick in the draft would guarantee them either jared goff who ended up going no 1 to the los angeles ram or wentz but according to paul depodesta the team chief strategy officer neither player wa enticing enough so the team instead traded

              " 'how electoral college cheat democracy november 13 2016 exclusive shadow over donald trump election is the fact that hillary clinton appears headed toward significant plurality of the national popular vote quirk from the archaic electoral college note daniel lazare by daniel lazare the election commentary now filling the internet seems distinctly out of touch many analyst are castigating hillary clinton for all the thing she did wrong her failure to connect with white worker in the rust belt her inability to sufficiently rally black and so on or they re criticizing the american people for falling for racist sexist know nothing like donald trump but these critic are ignoring the elephant in the parlor the simple fact is that american didn elect trump an ancient relic known a the electoral college did for better or worse plurality of the people voted for hillary clinton former secretary of state hillary clinton speaking with supporter at campaign rally in phoenix arizona march 21 2016 photo by gage skidmore indeed her margin of victory is turning out to be bigger than many imagined the latest count by the associated press ha her ahead by about half million popular vote or clinton 48 percent to trump 47 percent that about the same a george bush losing margin in 2000 before judicial coup état propelled him into office but nate cohen of the new york time upshot team is predicting that by the time all mail in absentee and provisional ballot are counted it will end up even bigger e a high a 2 2 million or 1 7 percent that ten time john kennedy margin of victory in 1960 and four time richard nixon in 1968 if true then clinton will not only have won in term of the popular vote she will have won big or a trump might say bigly or big league depending on how you decipher one of his favorite expression yet thanks to an obscure constitutional quirk she not the one going to the white house instead an orange haired reality tv star is so that he possibly can do to the united state what he did to his own real estate empire e drive it into bankruptcy failure of democracy three thing seem clear a consequence one is that america ha major problem on it hand after all this is the second time in 16 year that the people or at least plurality of the people have been robbed of their choice for president and both time political democracy ha suffered major body blow a consequence how much more abuse the democratic process can take without succumbing entirely is now open to question an artist rendering of the constitutional convention in 1787 second thing is that no one ha foggiest idea how to fix it third is that the ruling elite and it minion in the chattering class don give damn because in contrast to the population at large they benefit from the breakdown it much easier to control demoralized population that ha lost faith in the value of democracy and are therefore eager to sweep the entire issue under the rug so let take these issue on one at time and see where they lead first the problem the electoral college is very eighteenth century affair an example of what happens when new world pragmatism combine with the age of reason love affair with ancient rome faced with tentative new republic in which democracy tended to be limited local and individualist the framer concluded that special body of elite elector wa needed to hold the country together and ensure that solid leader like george washington took the rein the decision may not have been unreasonable given the exigency of the day the proposed constitution wa radical departure from the article of confederation which made the state supreme the constitution shifted sovereignty to we the people but the state especially the small one still wanted significant role in the new hybrid system unexpected problem but 230 year later the device ha turned out to have unexpected consequence by awarding one vote for every senator and representative that state sends to washington it triple the clout of demographic lilliputian like wyoming population 586 107 according to the most recent estimate at the expense of multi racial giant like california population 39 1 million by forcing presidential candidate to concentrate on handful of swing state it sideline democratic stronghold like california or new york along with republican bastion such a indiana or the deep south republican presidential candidate donald trump in an msnbc interview it also effectively cancel out million of vote since clinton carried new york state by 59 percent it mean that out of the 4 1 million people who voted her some 632 000 might just a well have stayed home since she carried california by 61 percent more than million golden state resident could have done the same since it make it possible to rack up majority of electoral vote by winning plurality in surprisingly small number of state contest one reform group ha calculated that candidate could conceivably win with a little a 30 percent of the popular vote overall indeed if third party make strong showing it could even be le since all the winning candidate would have to do is win 34 percent plurality in a few a 16 state a farfetched a such arithmetic may be it show how readily the two kind of vote electoral and popular can diverge the tighter the contest moreover the greater the chance that they will which is why they did so in 2000 when al gore and george bush were running neck and neck and again in 2016 when the race proved unexpectedly close rather than resolving difference fair and square it a process all but designed to leave the majority or plurality feeling cheated and scorned when race are hardest fought undercounting urban voter the electoral college also tip the balance in favor of the right by penalizing urban giant like california or new york where ten time a many people ride the subway each day a live in all of wyoming where hispanic and racial minority account for 44 percent of the ten most populous state they account for le than 30 percent of the ten least yet it the latter who benefit protest placard at rally in new york april 19 2016 photo by the all nite image flickr this is unfair undemocratic and downright racist but it also counterproductive because it prevents government from addressing human need where they are most likely to occur e in crowded city or traffic snarled suburb rather than in the big sky country of montana where hardly anyone life and cow outnumber people by better than two to one not that the electoral college is the only institution that shamelessly flouts the principle of one person one vote the senate is even worse since it give equal weight to california and wyoming even though the former population is some 67 time greater but not only do two wrong not make right but it turn out that democratic senatorial candidate collectively outpolled republican on tuesday a well by 45 2 million to 39 3 but so inequitable is the system that the gop still wound up with 51 seat majority something must be done which brings u to problem number two the solution the answer is that nothing can be done because under the current system the tool to fix it do not exist in 2006 stanford computer science professor named john koza came up with clever scheme to sidestep the electoral college by calling on each state to pledge it electoral vote to whoever won the popular tally once state accounting for majority of electoral vote a few a 16 a we have seen signed on it would be done deal but after ten state plus the district of columbia lined up behind koza reform the movement stalled one reason is that republican state have no incentive to support reform that clearly reduces their clout another is that swing state are even le inclined since they reap real life reward from their role a presidential battleground so the idea of democratizing the electoral college appears to be dead end no way out that leaf reform via constitutional amendment but this is the unlikeliest of all thanks to an arcane amending process that requires two third of each house plus three fourth of the state to approve any change no matter how minor the first is non starter since republican control both the house and senate while the second is even worse since it allows just 13 state to block any reform sought by the remainder s capitol thirteen micro population state representing a little a 4 4 percent of american are not likely to do away with an arrangement that augments their own power by the year 2030 they ll be even le likely since their share of the population by that point will have shrunk to just 3 5 percent according to census bureau projection unfairness thus appears to be locked in not for year or decade but for a long a the current constitutional arrangement persists which brings u to item number three the role of the political elite a the new york time pointed out on friday clinton criticized the electoral college during the battle of florida in november 2000 believe strongly that in democracy we should respect the will of the people she said and to me that mean it time to do away with the electoral college and move to the popular election of our president twelve year later trump lashed out at it a well tweeting that it is disaster for democracy this time around the silence is deafening trump didn mention it since he is obviously loath to quarrel with an arrangement that put him over the top but clinton said nothing in her concession speech about outpolling her opponent either why not one reason is that she had taken an oath to uphold the constitution a senator and had then invoked it too many time on the campaign trail to talk about changing the rule now that they had gone against her but another is that any mention would lead to question about how such an outmoded and inequitable system had been allowed to persist 16 year after the political disaster of bush gore why did the politician fail to fix system that is so obviously broken or for that matter even take any initial step how could they be so lax these are question that clinton now find inconvenient because she know there is no easy answer so she held her tongue her devotion to the constitutional status quo outweighs her loyalty to the plurality of american who voted for her one can only imagine how trump and his angry supporter would have reacted if trump triumphed in the popular vote but wa denied the presidency one might assume that he would cite that fact a proof that the system wa rigged losing credibility but the problem is not going away the system is in fact collapsing before our eye election are mess because they re in the hand of thousand of state and county official with their own special rule and procedure not because system like this make sense it obviously doesn but because that what the framer decreed or didn anticipate and no one know how to change it president james madison an architect of the s constitution and the bill of right but also virginia slave owner congress is frozen and corrupt while democratic accountability is nonexistent in an age of filibuster and anonymous senate hold allowing single legislator to prevent certain action such a confirmation vote for senior official from reaching the floor poland disappeared from the map in 1795 because bizarre liberum veto allowed gave each senator power to block any bill and thus throw the entire government into paralysis yet today senate hold allow individual legislator to do much the same meanwhile the only thing worse than rightwing thug like trump is rightwing thug whose legitimacy is in question and who therefore can be counted on to turn even more thuggish by way of compensation something should be done but nothing will be because the founder had no idea that the system would last a long a it ha and therefore neglected to include workable toolkit with which to perform the necessary repair it not pretty picture but it will not get any better until the people face the problem of how to fix it on their own daniel lazare is the author of several book including the frozen republic how the constitution is paralyzing democracy harcourt brace',\n",

this and ready for it at this stage red in condition red you know that there is an immediate threat in your presence however this is not necessarily the point at which one who is armed would fire upon target instead this is the point where one who is armed may draw their firearm and make command for an attacker to stop what they are doing it is important to take step to de escalate at all cost there is no reason to use deadly force if situation can be solved without it those who carry firearm especially those who open carry where concealed carry is criminalized are obligated to have heightened situational awareness at all time because any person who get within arm reach could possibly attempt to take the firearm from them on number of occasion concealed carry holder have stopped

you harm are not expecting you to be prepared to fight back and they will run when they see that you are prepared to defend yourself weapon of opportunity while firearm are effective tool of self defense they are not always available and sometimes they are not practical for this reason it is important to consider keeping weapon of opportunity on your person in your vehicle and even in your workplace weapon of opportunity is an everyday object that could be used a defensive weapon if needed having situational awareness only becomes truly effective when you have the tool of defense at your disposal various weapon of opportunity are likely sitting all around your home and workplace these are the heavy or sharp object that can be grabbed at moment notice like pen key belt or even

prosecuted for carrying opportune weapon like baseball bat but they had no substantiating evidence like baseball glove or ball to show that they meant to use the item for it intended use why gun control kill in some state like california and new york there have been such extreme gun control measure that non violent people have been prohibited from carrying firearm for self defense this mean that non criminal are treated the same a convicted felon in these state this only endangers life and force well to do people into vulnerable position in which they become defenseless target of murderer and thief and a we see today individual are being taken out of their car and brutalized by anti trump rioter like in chicago on of the most anti gun city in the country law have not stopped the illegal acquisition of firearm but they have caused many peaceful people to be victimized by criminal and it time that this bureaucratic overreach is reversed reestablishing the foundation of self defense and self sufficiency in our society will require that we maintain awareness of threat to life and liberty and that we keep the tool of defense close by our side ready to be used when the worst

grandparent rec room the complex is like an airy marbled museum with reminder maybe every 10 step that the cowboy once were dynasty super bowl ring super bowl trophy and hagiographic display of all five of the franchise super bowl victory but the shiniest part of the cowboy these day wa not in the complex blueprint it dak prescott who came out of nowhere to become the team new franchise quarterback prescott rookie drafted in the fourth round out of mississippi state led the team to 11 victory in row before sunday visit to new jersey to face the giant feat that not even troy aikman or roger staubach can claim but in visit to frisco last week it became even more clear how much prescott ascent like the team gleaming new home is yet another reminder of one man the cowboy have left behind tony romo know he want to play and know he want to be out there but he been really good about everything prescott said of romo he telling me about and thing he see with defense or thing he ha seen in the past he great the great tony romo you ll have to think back while to remember how great romo wa the undrafted rookie who became pro bowl player leading the cowboy to four playoff berth and posting only two losing season after taking over a the starter in 2006 but while his career propelled the cowboy forward year after year it is also sometimes remembered for what romo did not do when it mattered most there wa the botched hold on attempt that probably cost the cowboy chance for playoff win at seattle in 2007 the loss to the giant in the postseason year later that spoiled season the fade the poorly thrown ball and the dozen of sack and then there were the injury which continue to thwart him prescott is starting at all only because romo broke bone in his back in the preseason after his 2015 season ended early to boot now romo 36 is stuck in position that dreaded by every top athlete who know the clock is ticking on his career he watching the young prescott lead the greatest cowboy team in year to the playoff and knowing that wherever they go he will only be along for the ride he earned the right to be our quarterback a hard a it is for me to say romo said of prescott in what amounted to an official concession speech last month what is clear is that wa that kid once when romo wa that kid it wa all so much fun he sang journey don stop believin at his locker and he joked with the reporter who scribbled down his every word even when he wa injured he would brush off his physical problem because he wa absolutely positive that he would come back even better than ever most of the time he wa right when thing don go your way he once told me you just have to come right back and say let try this again let have some fun romo doesn look a if he having any fun now the black vinyl seat at his locker wa empty when visited texas last week next to it wa pile of paper with information about the giant and how the cowboy would match up romo had scribbled note in the margin knowing full well that it wa unlikely that he would play he doesn need to talk with reporter and so generally he doesn it a jarring change when covered the cowboy for the dallas morning news in 2003 just after romo wa signed a rookie free agent could always find him on the blue leather couch in the locker room motivational book in hand the dimple on his left cheek showing because he wa nearly always smiling for three season romo sat and watched the cowboy burn through quarterback after quarterback quincy carter drew henson vinny testaverde drew bledsoe romo friendly son of wisconsin seemed to know his time would come and just like that midway through the 2006 season it did he came in for bledsoe against the giant and he never looked back k that an exaggeration he probably looking back now and who would blame him for being nostalgic now likely closer to his 40th birthday than he is to starting in super bowl he must wonder if he will ever take snap for the cowboy for anyone again others on the team must be wondering the same thing though they won admit it want to do what give u the best chance to have tony contribute to championship the owner jerry jones said on his radio show last week tony ready to go tony not done said scott linehan the cowboy offensive coordinator tight end jason witten romo close friend and his favorite receiver struggled to even consider the idea that romo might never throw him another pas he fidgeted a he considered his answer and admitted that he didn really want to give one he and romo were rookie together they became the franchise player together they even became father at about the same time we ve kind of grown up together and went from being kid to being men at the same time witten said know that tony always going to be the same guy no matter what situation he dealing with and also believe he can still get it done on the field he paused for moment before adding but this game doesn slow down for anybody and tony understands that walking through the locker room in frisco on thursday romo looked le like an f starter and more like someone who had just rolled out of bed tousled hair unshaven face

of imperialism scapegoat for repression but not shaper of foreign policy black american anti imperialism an invisible subject for the new york time by bryan bullock from vietnam through iraq african american have proved to be the group of american most opposed to s military intervention the october 4 2016 issue of the new york time which contained the article syrian war magnifies tension in america global mission is case study in white supremacy the article is framed from totally white conservative and liberal frame and completely ignores the perspective of african american who traditionally and today are consistently and overwhelmingly anti imperialism and who tend to identify with other black and brown people across the globe including the palestinian and syrian the article purport to give both side of the argument for s intervention in the affair of sovereign nation the author of the article give the impression that they are being balanced in giving the view of those who support america mission in the world and those who are critical of said mission this false balance doe not include the perspective of any african american historian or critic of s foreign policy like professor gerald horne bill fletcher anthony monteiro glen ford or african american scholar like horace campbell in fact both side of any debate in the s regarding foreign policy are both white side this is particularly true when it come to s foreign policy where white are the only one who are presumed to either have an opinion on such issue or one that is worth mentioning it is true that both side could include black who adhere to the eurocentric party line view of the dominant s narrator say donna brazile or condoleezza rice or black on the so called left but their view still missing from this piece are not black critique it is eurocentric critique coming from black person which is fundamentally different than an african american critique viewed through the lens of the african american experience the idea view and critique of black thinker are notoriously absent in the page of the time when it come to foreign policy which prof that the writer the editorial staff and the paper itself doe not consider those view important and in ignoring those critique it also ignores the historical critical analysis of the people who are and have been the subject of s foreign policy the idea view and critique of black thinker are notoriously absent in the page of the time when it come to foreign policy it also completely ignores the analysis of great black historical thinker like e dubois walter rodney and paul robeson malcolm the late stage martin luther king jr a well a the organization they represented such a the council on african affair the caa the naacp of the 1940 the african liberation support committee the black panther party the african blood brotherhood the organization of afro american unity trans africa the s human right network the united negro improvement association or the national council of black lawyer all of whom were deeply critical of america so called mission in the world especially a it related to african and asian people like haitian congolese syrian yemeni and palestinian the critique of these people are irrelevant to not only the time but in truth to the democratic and republican party the current incarnation of the naacp the black congressional caucus president obama and most white liberal formation however this is not reason to give the time pas even the use of the word mission with the european habit of sending missionary into africa and the america to soften the people up with european religion before they were subdued by hard power doe not elicit irony on the part of the time the white man burden of civilizing the darker race of the world through enslavement destroying their religion culture language colonizing their land and resource and extracting their people and whisking them away to foreign land to toil from birth to death for free is just a important and essential part of the history of america global mission a anything else mentioned in the piece the hand wringing of the mostly white imperialist on the left and on the right regarding the proper way to engage in imperialism is essentially what the piece present no other perspective or voice are important or valid thus the perspective of african american thinker are only relevant in american discourse when it concern black issue like police brutality but not on international issue although many black writer and thinker would argue the two are connected this is so even though the very presence people of african descent in america is direct result of the united state foreign policy of capturing importing and enslaving african people this point is lost on white foreign policy writer however early black thinker were clear on this point people like dubois and robeson in the past and contemporary like glen ford were are fiercely anti imperialist the perspective of african american thinker are only relevant in american discourse when it concern black issue like police brutality but not on international issue the white imperialist presentation in the article excludes the idea of syrian american indigenous population mexican and puerto rican american and hawaiian all of whom may have totally different idea of america obligation in syria penny von eschen note in the book race against empire black american and anticolonialism 1937 1957 that objecting to s support for south african and the european colonial power and increasingly challenging the notion that america wa the legitimate leader of the free world and therefore above censure black american both criticized new direction in american foreign policy and attempted to use the united nation a forum in which to gain support for civil right struggle in the united state african american are no le critical of america self serving mission today a wa then african american were highly critical of the s violent overthrow of the african nation of libya it aggression toward cuba in the 60 and venezuela in the chavez era and today we have not forgotten america refusal to recognize haiti a an independent black nation when it defeated the french nor are we unmindful of the s invasion of haiti in 1915 and it support of dictator of the duvalier family the coup of the aristide government and the fact that president obama tried to prevent aristide from returning to haiti black thinker on international issue are highly supportive of the palestinian cause and troubled by the continued expansion of africom the s africa command on the continent this analysis is glaringly absent from mainstream medium portrayal of america duty in the world the time article offer the view that because many american see their foreign policy a grand mission to make the world better place they tend to divide the world into hero who support their ideal and villain who oppose them but which american are the writer talking about and whose ideal are represented in s foreign policy it is certain that the view of people like george padmore leader in the pan african movement in the 40 and 50 are not represented by this view padmore wa clear that empire and peace are incompatible michael dawson note in black in and out of the left from vietnam through iraq african american have proved to be the group of american most opposed to s military intervention it is also purposely forgotten that the black panther party wa following in the footstep of their ideological predecessor malcolm staunchly anti imperialist a eldridge cleaver noted the s wa bankrolling and arming all of the oppressive regime around the world one of the agenda item contained in the national black political agenda created in gary indiana in 1972 called for an end to the vietnam war and the immediate withdrawal of foreign troop from asia and africa the withdrawal of s military corporation and communication facility from southern africa and the third world self determination of puerto rico and the virgin island an end to sanction against cuba and the closure of the american military base at guantanamo bay cuba african american were highly critical of the s violent overthrow of the african nation of libya it aggression toward cuba in the 60 and venezuela in the chavez era and today contemporary white american analysis of s foreign excludes the historical reality that in thinking of america support of so called rebel in syria and libya it is clear to african american that america never supported single african liberation group in africa it is not lost on black american that the african national congress and nelson mandela were considered terrorist by the s no african rebel movement seeking independence from the dutch british french german portuguese or italian colonizer of african land ever received single drop of military support from washington the s never supported the mau mau in kenya nor frelimo in mozambique nor the anc in south africa or any other revolutionary movement on the continent in fact the contrary is true from the coup against kwame nkrumah in ghana to the assassination of patrice lumuumba in the congo to the capture of nelson mandela and to the support the racist apartheid system of south african and the murderous colonial regime in the former rhodesia the american government ha consistently and forcefully opposed revolutionary movement in africa and in fact supported their colonial oppressor the only country to ever militarily support african liberation wa cuba not the s regarding mandela who the s considered terrorist we heard him clearly when in response to request to condemn fidel castro yassar arafat and mommar ghadifi he said your enemy are not necessarily our enemy indeed not only did castro send troop to aid the angolan in defeating the south african he also provided refuge for many african american freedom fighter from robert williams to assata shakur while the s wa infiltrating surveilling and murdering black political activist in the black panther party leader of north vietnam china algeria and cuba welcomed them a ambassador of the african american community it is clear to african american that america never supported single african liberation group understanding this historical reality black thinker are justifiably critical and suspicious of s intention in place like iraq iran syria and libya the greatest thinker in african american culture explicitly made the connection between the s and european colonialism abroad in place like syria a an extension of the domestic policy of treating african american a second class citizen or a some african american thinker have argued the domestic colonization of black people the genocide of the native american resonates with black american leader from mlk who connected america imperialism in vietnam and the tax dollar used to support it to the lack of financial resource available to be used to build city and provide basic wage to malcolm who traveled the globe making personal connection with african head of state including nasser in egypt it wa malcolm who saw the historic opportunity of the bandung conference where 29 asian and african post colonial nation met to discus their own fate independent of colonial power including the s black american support for anti imperialist movement did not find space in the time analysis of syria the writer and editorial staff at the time are oblivious to the history of the third world people living in their midst therefore for black people who understand this history they recognize article like the one published in the time a imperial propaganda piece for global white supremacy yet the time in that regard is no different than any other white american newspaper magazine or news program or politician they all even or especially the black one present eurocentric worldview that excludes the idea history and analysis of it black population we are irrelevant we serve the function we have always served subject of imperialism scapegoat for repression but not shaper of foreign policy black can nominally participate in the american experience but only so long a we stay in our place and a long a we support the manifest destiny of the global hegemon and not get in it way we are cannon fodder for the imperialist war abroad and casualty in the s war on drug and on poor black life at home malcolm traveled the globe making personal connection with african head of state including nasser in egypt the presence of black face at the head of the empire ha provided cover for s imperialism in africa and asia but it ha not diminished the anti imperialism of the black community it ha silenced the voice of the self appointed black leader and revealed them to be supporter of empire and oppression the time too or rather again reveals itself a supporter of the pentagon by publishing an article that is short on true analysis of america support of terrorist in syria a well a presenting limited white supremacist parameter of debate although the african american tradition of anti imperialism may not be important to the time it is tradition that is still alive nonetheless and neither the black face of the empire nor the white press in service to it can diminish it our antagonism against imperialism may not be publicized in the page of the time but it life on in our continued support for amnesty for assata shakur the release of all political prisoner from leonard peltier to jalil muntiquim and oscar rivera lopez to support for palestinian self determination to opposition to the re colonization of africa by america africa command to the growing support by black athlete young and old of colin kaepernick refusal to stand for the national anthem to our opposition to all s war of aggression including the one in libya and syria african american opposition to the s supported aggression in syria masquerading a humanitarian support is obviously irrelevant to the time but malcolm told u plainly year ago that the medium would have u thinking the good guy wa the bad guy and vice versa so whether or even if assad is ruthless dictator the term the s ha used against everyone from castro to chavez it doe not therefore mean that african american agree that the s ha the right to support insurrection in syria we know imperialism is euro american white capitalist venture that is carried against the darker nation not for them

my daughter thought he wa hilarious although she took some time to warm up to him mr gaffigan tell joke that kid can relate to with many reference they understand at recent show at foxwoods resort casino in mashantucket conn he did bit about the horribleness of mary had little lamb and another about the laziness of the grandfather in charlie and the chocolate factory and in line with the trend he did material from the perspective of cranky parent when he joked about his own child what considered funny penny saw a punching down he funny but that mean she said in debrief after the show her hand balling up into fist what put him back in her favor wa story he told in which he wet himself peeing pooping and farting are comedy classic at least little funny to anyone honest with themselves

code for ugly penny doubled over laughing even though she had no idea what character actor meant joke of course can be funny if you don understand every word truth kid grasp better than adult do secret code are just fun she said matter of fact mr gaffigan show had gone so well that decided to be more ambitious by taking penny to carolines the next night to see the charming rising comic ron funches he is not a clean but ha twee giggly delivery that thought might appeal it wa bad miscalculation when didn have my hand over her ear in response to joke with more cursing or sexual innuendo than could handle she wa usually just confused staring blankly at bit by mr funches about spending more money than he ha penny said don get any of this we left early in retrospect taking child to new

in the front row penny wa rapt during bit poking fun at different kind of author photo laughing merrily at shot of jovial guy wearing book like hat m nancherla called the look bookhead midway through her set however the slide froze and the comic wa left onstage with nothing to play off struggling to save her set she made up few joke on the spot about the slide frozen onscreen which a it happened just said dad before prematurely ending the show penny wa disappointed but liked the improvisation it wa fun to watch her make stuff up she said which may help explain why it easier to find improv for child than wanted the whole thing like that by the end of my weeklong experiment hadn convinced my daughter that comedy is better than harry potter movie but she had good time at two of the three show kid are individual with their own taste but the greatest comedy tap into some of the same thing that the most popular child book do delight in language the purely silly and grand sense of mischief

not threaten jerry seinfeld child have always devoured fell in love with comedy when wa around my daughter age spending hour trying to understand the joke on my older brother steve martin album but

racist these aren sexist with his typically unambiguous assessment the vice president thrust himself into heated debate that ha shaped the democrat since donald trump won the presidency should the party continue tailoring it message to the young and nonwhite constituency that propelled president obama or make more concerted effort to win over the white voter who have drifted away for democrat the election last month ha become rorschach test some see mr clinton loss a result of an unfortunate series of fluke russian tampering late intervention by the federal bureau of investigation director and poor allocation of resource but little more than speed bump on the road to demographic majority others believe the result reflect more worrisome trend that could doom the party it is sensitive topic touching on race and class but the choice that democrat make in the coming month will shape their identity and carry major implication in both the 2018 midterm election and the next presidential

iowa governor had tried to push mr clinton longtime ally toward focusing more on rural america but his plea fell on deaf ear he wa just a exasperated over what he described a his party pattern of neglect of many of the voter he spent eight year working with in his cabinet post rural america is 15 percent of america population mr vilsack said it the same percentage a it the same percentage a hispanic we spend lot of time thinking about that 15 percent and we should god bless them we should but not to the exclusion of the other 15 percent in their zeal for pursuing clearly defined constituency some democrat now worry they missed the bigger picture failing to deliver message that would cut across all constituency and ceding too much territory to republican in whiter more conservative area that mr trump won by wider margin than other recent republican nominee entering the race for chairman of the democratic national committee on thursday labor secretary thomas perez summed up this view in blunt term we got our as kicked in lot of these rural pocket because we weren there in sufficient force mr perez said representative gwen graham democrat of florida and likely candidate for governor in 2018 called her party message too funneled it needed to be more open to pursuing moderate and conservative voter she said m graham who wa elected in district in the florida panhandle said she would campaign across every part of the state if she ran for governor though she declined to criticize her party presidential nominee directly such campaigning would be starkly different from the approach mr clinton took in 2016 when she focused overwhelmingly on the state biggest metropolitan area would run strategy m graham said and would reach out to all different kind of democrat and republican along the ideological spectrum but while this may make for good message at the outset of campaign it is to vocal contingent of democratic strategist dated approach that ignores inexorable political and demographic trendlines to win in changing country these democrat said the party must tailor platform and strategy that explicitly appealed to younger and nonwhite voter on issue like policing climate change and immigration cornell belcher democratic pollster said it wa folly to continue developing message for and devoting considerable resource to shrinking increasingly resistant market mr belcher recalled focus group in north carolina this year in which nonwhite voter who had come out for mr obama two election could not name the party senate candidate in the state it wa deborah ross she lost we re spending all of our resource on broadcast television chasing this mythical unicorn white swing voter he said mr belcher who ha published new book about race and the obama presidency black man in the white house said the party should not ignore white voter but he said democrat also should not react to this election by refashioning their appeal a if the country were just a white a it wa when bill clinton and other centrist began the democratic leadership council 30 year ago why would we go back to running campaign a though it the 1980s mr belcher asked because it not the 1980s mr pfeiffer the former obama adviser noted that red state like arizona and georgia were closer to turning blue this year even a mr clinton lost and argued that new arrival in florida and north carolina would make those state tilt democratic yet even democrat in solidly blue state who can in theory win election without single conservative vote said the party message wa lacking mayor eric garcetti of los angeles said democrat had not explained to many voter how tolerant social value translated into government action of course we are for tolerant diverse inclusive cooperative future he said it isn enough mr garcetti likened the party message to the gesture of conciliation proposed by civic leader in los angeles after the rodney king riot in the 1990s well intentioned but insufficient if the starting point is hey we are party and we are country that stand for black and korean and people of all stripe liking each other that not an agenda mr garcetti said

is an area of interest for many people that continually growing and for good reason via collectiveevolution intelligent being from other star system have been and are visiting our planet earth they are variously referred to a visitor others star people et etc they are visiting earth now this is not matter of conjecture or wistful thinking theodor loder iii phd professor emeritus of earth science university of new hampshire scroll down for video below this is in large part due to the fact that we now have hundred of credible witness that have officially testified to the reality of an extraterrestrial presence and it relation to the already disclosed ufo problem this is why member of government like john podesta chief of staff for bill clinton counsellor to barack obama and head of hillary clinton presidential campaign before she dropped out stated that the time to pull the curtain back on this subject is long overdue we have statement from the most credible source those in position to know about fascinating phenomenon the nature of which is yet to be determined taken from leslie kean 2010 new york time bestseller ufo general pilot and government official go on the record in which podesta wrote the forward although keep in mind government have been deceiving u on several different topic throughout history it safe to assume that they would use ufo disclosure for their own personal interest in the same way they ve used false flag terrorism something to think about but definitely topic for another article a the 4 approached range of 25 nautical mile it lost all instrumentation and communication when the 4 turned away from the object and apparently wa no longer threat to it the aircraft regained all instrumentation and communication another brightly lighted object came out of the original object the second object headed straight toward the f4 one example out of hundred involving the military intercept of ufo that wa tracked on air radar ground radar and visually confirmed by pilot source why it time to listen to contactees abductees experiencers psychological standpoint just to clarify contactees are usually those who have reported friendly contact experience with extraterrestrial abductees are those who have had what they perceive to be fearful experience and experiencers are those who neither view the experience a good or bad but simply just an experience it important to note this because various people have reported different type of experience with different type of being yes there have been crashed craft and body recovered we are not alone in the universe they have been coming here for long time dr edgar mitchell scd 6th man to walk on the moon source source the reality is that some people who claim to have had contact with intelligent extraterrestrial being actually have john mack harvard professor psychiatrist and pulitzer price recipient stress that yes it both it both literally physically happening to degree and it also some kind of psychological spiritual experience occurring and originating perhaps in another dimension and so the phenomenon stretch u or it asks u to stretch to open to reality that are not simply the literal physical world but to extend to the possibility that there are other unseen reality from which our consciousness our if you will learning process over the past several hundred year have closed u off source we published an article earlier this year regarding john mack and more than 60 school child witnessing non human being and large craft landing the child were interviewed by him and it wa quite remarkable story with all of the child providing very similiar story until this day these child have been speaking of it an event occurred more than 20 year ago they describe these event like person talk about something that ha happened to them can tell that these are people of sound mind telling me something quote continued and taken from the video linked below dr john mack professor of psychiatry harvard medical school you can watch this video of mack interview the child and you can read this article that go more into detail on that case according to retired mcgill university professor in the department of psychology research area being cognition and cognitive neuroscience dr don donderi some of what people report a ufo are extraterrestrial et vehicle some of those extraterrestrial vehicle actually have et crew and some of those et crew catch and release human source academician like these and others like richard dolan david jacob and more have been studying this phenomenon for decade and the report of being and examining why they are here what they are doing what they look like and more ha been documented by their and others research what find most fascinating about these story is how many of them seem to compliment each other instead of contradicting each other which just add to the mystery a far a physical research go there are great many photograph of such body mark many of which are in an equilateral triangle pattern of red dot on the wrist or near the ankle also common are scoop mark in which it appears a if small amount of tissue wa removed from beneath the skin leaving an indentation richard dolan taken from his book ufo for the 21st century mind below is clip of dr roger leir doctor of podiatric medicine and arguably the

astronaut and princeton physic professor put it there is abundant evidence that we are being contacted that civilization have been visiting u for vary long time the information below is very brief summary of few of the most commonly reported extraterrestrial based on all of the research ve done on this subject human looking extraterrestrial extraterrestrial with feature drastically similar to human being have reported by contactees abductees and experiencers for long time this type of experience is actually quite common many people have reported that they ve been taken into ship and warned about the direction the human race is heading they re also often portrayed a assisting our planet in various way both on physical level and an energetic one decade ago visitor from other plant warned u about where we were headed and offered to help but instead we or at least some of u interpreted their visit a threat and decided to shoot first and ask question after paul hellyer former canadian defense minister source there have also been report of human looking extraterrestrial working with human inside of what known a the military industrial complex with regard to making technological advancement this is why in the highly classified world the black budget world it probably the independent government contractor that are working in these area story of human like extraterrestrial date from the beginning of time all the way up to the present day and historical literature is littered with account of these type of encounter my people tell of star people who came to u many generation ago the star people brought spiritual teaching and story and map of the cosmos and they offered these freely they were kind loving and set great example when they left u my people say there wa loneliness like no other richard wagamese ojibway author source a far a the picture above am not sure if it real or fake but that not the point it wa used to spark your imagination it is supposedly one of the extraterrestrial that wa discovered dead inside of ship that wa located on the moon retrieved from one of the apollo mission the picture to your left wa released by professor by the name of bruno sammaciccia catholic historian with degree in psychology and psychiatry he wa the author of more than 100 book and well known distinguished figure in italian academic circle he is thought to have taken this photograph of an alleged 10 foot tall extraterrestrial being in italy in 1976 if you read the lore there are many story of mysterious group of extraterrestrial who look like human and who established underground base in italy meeting with local resident between 1956 and 1978 not long before his death sammaciccia claimed he had had direct physical contact with extraterrestrial over several decade dr roberto pinotti leading italian ufologist ha since confirmed his decade long knowledge of the sammaciccia case when it come to human extraterrestrial contact in modern history this case rank among the most compelling given the picture and the number of witness involved here is brief summary of the sammaciccia contact story a given by ufo researcher dr michael salla founder of exopolitics org in 1956 when bruno sammaciccia and two friend met with two mysterious individual who said they were extraterrestrial one wa over 8 foot tall while the other wa just over 3 foot sammaciccia and his friend initially skeptical were eventually taken into large underground base where they saw more of the alleged extraterrestrial they also saw their child being educated some of the advanced technology they used and their space ship finally convinced that they were really having physical contact with extraterrestrial sammaciccia and his friend began to help the extraterrestrial they began with material support by arranging for truckloads of fruit food and other material to be transported and unloaded at an extraterrestrial base eventually two truckloads of supply were being delivered every month to base in different region of italy where sammaciccia and his assistant lived sammaciccia finally described violent conflict between two faction of extraterrestrial trying to influence humanity development and future while his friendship faction promoted cosmic unity and ethical development the other faction promoted technological development at all cost this led to periodic violent clash between the faction eventually the underground base of sammaciccia extraterrestrial friend wa destroyed in 1978 survivor had to leave the earth but promised to return at future time when humanity wa ready for more ethical future of humanity interacting with extraterrestrial sammaciccia astounding story sound like an episode from star trek but it is well supported by documentary evidence some of italy finest ufo researcher and first hand witness of the event described some of the witness were leading statesman scholar and high society figure from italy and europe below is lecture given by one of the world foremost researcher of this topic timothy good he go into detail about this supposed encounter a well a many others to the left you will see picture that wa given to the world by phil schneider phil wa very controversial figure a wa his death he wa born in 1947 and wa the son of oscar and sally schneider oscar wa captain in the united state navy who apparently worked in nuclear medicine and helped design the first nuclear submarine he wa also supposedly part of the famous philadelphia experiment a well a operation crossroad program to test nuclear weapon oscar schneider is the gentleman to the right of the man with the red circle around his head phil man in the video below apparently oscar son and oscar appear to resemble each other quite strongly the man with the circle around his head is the supposed extraterrestrial the others are apparently some of the world top physicist from the time philip claimed to be an ex government structural engineer who wa involved in building underground military base dumb around the country we ve actually published couple of detailed article about dumbs whose existence is not mere speculation other common look are tall muscular with long hair blue eye and blond hair the same type of figure ha also been reported with black and white being some report have detailed being with blue skin larger eye a well a shorter being with little more round of head there seems to be large variation and possibility of several different looking human like extraterrestrial being this raise some very interesting question regarding the origin of our specie if the humanoid form is common throughout the universe what doe that mean contanctee commonly refer to these being being from various star system like arcturus sirius andromeda and the pleiades just to name few cat bird like humanoid like above being are also fairly common among supposed encounter it also noteworthy to mention that all type of being seem to communicate using telepathy the following is selected list of downloadable peer reviewed journal article on psi psychic phenomenon most published in the 21 st century you can click here related ce article s defence physicist spill the bean on what really happening on the moon the grey alien the grey alien is another very common type of extraterrestrial that been reported by several abductees contactees and experiencers report range from small three to four foot tall being all the way up to seven to nine foot tall being and everything in between one of the most common type of experience among several abductees is one in which they have their sperm or egg extracted many have gone through what seems to be pretty scary experience despite the fact that multiple time people have reported the being communicating to them and trying to calm them down and tell the person that they weren going to cause any harm to them at other time forceful abduction go without any communication many abductee report being impregnated and then abducted year after to see their hybrid child this seems to be very common experience and suggests that this race grey are creating human grey hybrid race or have been tinkering with the dna of human being for quite some time many researcher have suggested that these hybrid are already here and that many baby being born today could have been tinkered with there have also been sighting of grey like being taking vegetation from our planet perhaps to study alien scientist there have also been report of woman being impregnated by supposed extraterrestrial or extraterrestrial human hybrid shortly after the experience the woman are taken by government agency and the baby is removed and taken away to be studied by them it not uncommon for these people who have had these experience to get visit by these unknown people who seem to want to know more about the ufo extraterrestrial phenomenon there are some report of race like these working with certain government or shadow government in technological exchange program have come across story in my research where some group of being warn the human race not work with other group of being these story are endless and quite fascinating but ll save that for another article reptilian the reptilian type being is one that been reported and depicted in various human culture that date back thousand of year all the way up to the present day these being have been reported a friendly not so friendly and in between that a common theme throughout most supposed extraterrestrial specie the fact that two different being of the same race can be reported a benevolent and the other a malevolent many people seem to believe that reptilian type being are one out of many working behind the scene with those who control the government to en slave the human race some even believe that that the global elite are in large part reptilian in origin to be honest it not that far fetched after researching this topic in depth for almost decade there is no doubt in my mind that not only have government and shadow government become aware of the extraterrestrial presence but they ve interacted with several different group of extraterrestrial it ok to ask these question just to re emphasize that thing like this need to be discussed more because they are and have been discussed at the highest level of government in secret for almost one hundred year for example this particular fbi document wa addressed to certain scientist of distinction to aeronautical and military authority and to number of public official the document is letter that wa sent to the director of fbi in washington from the san fransisco office on matter pertaining to ufo extraterrestrial lt colonel name redacted of g2 g2 mean army intelligence san francisco advised today he ha no further information and that our seattle office is in possession of all information known by him and is handling the matter at tacoma washington the document go on to provide copy of letter written by someone with several university degree and former university department head the memorandum also state that the mere fact that the data herein were obtained by so called supernormal mean is probably sufficient to insure it disregard by nearly all person addressed key word above the fact that they would like to insure it disregard by nearly everyone addressed doe this mean that some of the people addressed should not disregard it the letter go on to outline and state that page 21 22 part of the disk carry crew others are under remote control their mission is peaceful the visitor contemplate settling on this planet these visitor are human like but much larger in size they are not excarnate earth people but come from their own world the disk posse some type of radiant energy they do not come from any planet a we use the word but from an etheric planet which interpenetrates with our own and is not perceptible to u the body of the visitor and the craft also automatically materialize on entering the vibratory rate of our dense matter they re enter the etheric at will and so simply disappear from our vision without trace the region they come from is not the astral plane but corresponds to the lakas or tala student of esoteric matter will understand these term please keep in mind that there are probably many different type of extraterrestrial out there and many different kind that have interacted with humanity in some way the above document is probably referring to one specific race don know this is one out of thousand of example of document and it not even one that would pick a most startling we should definitely be thinking about why these document were concealed from the public for decade and think about what other information still lay dormant inside of the military industrial complex when it come to extraterrestrial being you can see example of document that go into detail on what happens when the military track ufo on radar here for our latest article on the ufo extraterrestrial topic you can check out the exopolitics section of our website by clicking here there is serious possibility that we are being visited and have been visited for many year by people from outer space from other civilization and it behooves u in case some of these people in the future or now should turn hostile to find out who they are where they come from and what they want this should be the subject of rigorous scientific investigation and not the subject of rubishing by tabloid newspaper lord admiral hill norton former chief of defence staff 5 star admiral of the royal navy chairman of the nato military committee source you may be thinking that this is absolutely ridiculous know many people read the title of article like this one and turn their head and scoff immediately shutting down the possibility that these could be actual photo of extraterrestrial being why do we hold onto our view so staunchly at the expense of logic and reason what prevents u from considering new idea and new way of viewing the world so much new information is emerging every day which challenge the current accepted framework of knowledge and it can be difficult for our opinion to evolve a quickly a the science nonetheless this is an extremely important topic especially with the recent disclosure of unidentified flying object ufo by various government and defence intelligence agency and we must work past our reluctance to accept new idea these object are constantly photographed and tracked on radar a well a visually confirmed by the pilot who are sent out to see them and we would be foolish to discount this kind of evidence photo taken by two royal canadian air force pilot on august 27th 1957 in mccleod alberta canada is another example of such evidence the pilot were flying in formation of four f86 sabre jet aircraft one of the pilot described the phenomenon a bright light which wa sharply defined a disk shaped and which looked like shiny silver dollar sitting horizontal another pilot managed to photograph the object a you can see above there are number of study published in reputable peer reviewed journal analyzing these case this specific sighting lasted for couple of minute and the case wa analyzed by dr bruce maccabee who estimated from available data the luminosity of the object the power output within the spectral range of the film to be many megawatt the sturrock panel also found that strong magnetic field surrounding the phenomenon or object wa common occurrence if it doe indeed turn out that there is relevant physical evidence if this evidence is carefully collected and analyzed and if this analysis lead to the identification of several fact concerning the ufo phenomenon then will be the time for scientist to step back and ask what are these fact trying to tell u if those fact are strong enough to lead to firm conclusion then will be the time to confront the more bizarre question if for instance it turn out that all physical evidence is consistent with mundane interpretation of the cause of ufo report there will be little reason to continue to speculate about the role of extraterrestrial being if on the other hand the analysis of physical evidence turn up very strong evidence that object related with ufo report were manufactured outside the solar system then one must obviously consider very seriously that the phenomenon involves not only extraterrestrial vehicle but probably also

html through deceptive interdimensional intervention humanity ha been disconnected from the source and downgraded that he may be enslaved within the matrix of society but now the divine light is shining in his heart again the human soul is healing and through the activation of kundalini reconnecting fully with the source we re channeling that light through our being and out into the world which is beginning to break down the old fear based reality it time for humanity to get off his knee and rise up to peel off this limiting intervention by initiating the divine being within how doe that work how do we resurrect those divine gift that are our birth right the seven bodily vehicle of expression we are multi dimensional being stretching into the highest level of consciousness the human soul flow downwards through ever decreasing vibrational plain of existence like stream cascading down the mountain from the source the stream of our soul interacts with the dimension at various consciousness exchange point known a chakras where unity consciousness a the soul flow into separation consciousness a the bodily vehicle the overriding purpose is to initiate divine act of creativity right action by which to experience who we really are in my observation here how that flow is supposed to happen by bringing conscious awareness to this information can direct you through internal awareness how to reactivate your divine human 7 spirit light body merkaba the spirit light body wa designed to receive soul consciousness through the crown chakra to align our being with the right dimensional activity inline with our higher purpose through the spirit light body the soul ha the capacity to act through multiple plane of consciousness simultaneously it interconnects u with all other sentient life and is able to harmonise with the co creative intent of other soul within our sphere of influence our divine purpose could be channeling in the harmonistic light of the fifth dimensional realm to which we are ascending it could be counteracting opposing consciousness in the fourth dimensional realm to prevent distortional interference alternatively it could be bringing absolute presence into the third dimension to fulfill creative activity thus the spirit light body shine the light of our soul interdimensionally 6 celestial body the celestial body harness and store reflection of our soul through the countless lifetime we ve experienced it purpose is to help u align with our true aspect of beingness the downward shining light of the soul is next received into the third eye chakra which look into the outer world comparing what it see to the reflection of the soul in the celestial body when the soul notice it own brilliance it help u align with and unfold those aspect of beingness that are most becoming of u we settle into our groove so to speak it is that feeling of complete self belief self confidence self acceptance and contentment when we can notice ourselves manifested in the outer world through our own authentic inner reflection that is when we are truly living we are frequently reduced to tear at the seemingly simplest of thing because we are fulfilling our divine purpose 5 higher mind from authentic being arises authentic creation the purpose of higher mind is to harmonise with the divine flow of synchronicity and initiate right action aligned with the universe through the power of the celestial body we have noticed how to be within the external world and now is the time to experience this through creative action at this stage the creative impulse is quite abstract and undefined the purpose is more about creative intent and co creating with other sentient life rather than an actual creation itself the soul now act through higher mind gathering together elementals of consciousness into directional flow of right action like swirling cloud in the heaven 4 causal body the causal body is where our karma is held it is the cause of our incarnation it set the agenda for our learning experience based on the attachment and creative experience we need to evolve through a the soul shine it beam of creative light down through the higher vehicle our karma cast shadow of attachment through the lower body and into our outer experience the causal body also known a the energy body now attracts and manifest exactly the right condition to unveil the learning experience required for our evolution we are invited to confront and dissolve the obscuring cloud of karma by fulfillment of non judgmental right action we perceive this directing influence a pull through the heart center this is the way to go now 3 lower mind lower mind is designed to receive interpret and process higher channeled knowing through our clairvoyant clairaudient and clairsentient psychic skill so now we know what to do the question is how to do it if our authentic creative action doe not get side tracked the gathering energy are next passed into our subconscious or lower mind lower mind then help u to connect the dot within the co creative weave through the clairvoyant clairaudient and clairsentient skill of lower mind we notice rhythm and pattern of synchronicity in our consciousness landscape and have clear vision of the garment to be created a right action click into place moment by moment it becomes abundantly clear what we are being invited to do and how to do it 2 emotional body the emotional body build energy passion and conviction around our behaviour to bring our creative right action into fruition the creative process ha now gathered together the right fabric for our creation but it now ha to be woven into form the soul now utilizes the emotional body to garner more consciousness elementals and weave emotion around the creative act it provides multi coloured palette of experience that brings the garment to life it make the illusionary reality feel very real yielding meaning and sense of purpose to life however once the creative action ha come to fruition the weave of the garment is meant to quickly unwind again so that something else may be created it is not part of the human design that we hang onto emotion and build identity around them a is so often the case 1 physical body the physical body provides the ultimate vehicle to bring the creative downward flowing process into full expression it provides the experience of separation of one thing relative to another finally the soul gathering weave of elementals take form around our ultimate vehicle of creative expression the physical body a the master weaver our brain read the pattern that ha been crafted through our higher bodily vehicle and then orchestrates magical symphony of activity throughout our billion of material cell the physical body finally brings life to the creative action experienced in the myriad of human physical possibility the physical body is multifaceted mirror of higher creative intent it is the jewel in the crown when functioning a designed it make the illusion of reality real why is it then that most people don experience natural human beingness in this way the matrix system of control we live in system of control our lower mind emotional and physical body are over stimulated with constant dis harmonious distraction corporate marketeers government and the powerful build unnatural life style propagated constantly through tv newspaper radio and other medium the surrounding energy field is bombarded with electromagnetic interference through mobile phone satellite microwave and wifi our food is purposefully infused with addictive substance processed sugar caffeine artificial colouring pesticide hormone and gmo our water is contaminated with nitrate from the industrial foodchain and so called medicinal drug that end up being constantly recirculated in our water system it would seem our society ha been perfectly configured to desensitise and condition soul to conform to lower pattern of behavior the average home ha constant residual electric field due to over use of electronic gadgetry most house are awash with toxic chemical used to clean and disinfect which in actual fact damage and lower our energetic sensitivity the same can be said for the unnatural polyester and other oil based compound used to make our clothes the overall effect if to create addictive conditioned behaviour in the lower mind and physical body which then trap fragment and dissipate the flow of the soul into continual repetitive eddy current so the downward flowing soul is truncated at the solar plexus our lower mind and just like software on computer neural web of behaviour form in the brain locking the soul into false self persona this false self then creates lower based life style which can be readily controlled by the ntervention agenda so perfect is this system of control many awakening people are left with the inescapable conclusion that it wa designed and perpetuated that way to enslave people so how do we liberate ourselves and return to authenticity once more our journey of ascension after century of incarnation and losing ourselves in this artificial drama we re being gifted an opportunity powerful wave of higher consciousness is beginning to activate within people heart this christ consciousness a some call it although not of religious nature ha been dispatched to liberate those who are ready to step out of the maze this energy work by sounding note vibration which resonates with and therefore amplifies the sound of our soul that it may be heard once more above the outer noise of society the christ consciousness help reconnect with the unity of all life and the cosmic library of all knowing it help reactivate the natural flow within so what can we do in our day to day life to facilitate the maximum inflow of this evolutionary consciousness how may we provide the most fertile inner ground for the seed to germinate and grow our book five gateway ha plenty of insight guidance and tool that awakening soul can benefit from here below are seven recommendation from the book 1 surrender be absolutely clear that the only game going on in the universe is self realisation and that we might a well finally surrender and take an active part in that game rather than trying to conveniently ignore it while it play with u so accept that all event happening and circumstance have but one purpose to discover our absolute completeness our absoluteness beyond all circumstance realise the aim of the game is to be completely free inside whatever happens 2 become the observer the next step is to become the observer of ourselves in all activity event and circumstance we notice where we lose our temper where we become tight inside because of other people behaviour where we might blame another for the reality we are creating ourselves where our addiction to something in particular cause u to act in predictable way when we notice this firstly it is important just to watch it accept responsibility for it but not judge ourselves in this way we are already beginning to break free it also important to contemplate and utilise technique for regaining the place of the observer when we lose it which inevitably happens in the beginning it could be deep breathing exercise for example visualisation meditation or mantra of some kind some people find it of particular benefit to put up strategically placed post it note around the house let go for instance 3 open the heart next we need to open the heart further by attuning to those experience that generate the sublime taste of divine oneness the feeling such a lightness expansiveness timelessness and infinite peace so the key is to follow those experience that give u joy a much a possible what make our heart sing until we are tuning in consistently throughout the day whilst we are in the experience it is still paramount that we re observing ourselves in it so it could be few moment of deep breathing at our desk walking in the lunch break admiring natural beauty or doing the gardening after work whatever crumbles our cookie the key is to be watching ourselves in our joy 4 follow the inner pull a the heart open we begin to notice the natural synchronistic order of thing and an inner pull to right action sometimes this pull can be felt a an energy through the heart chakra sometimes it is simple inner knowing this is what to do now in which case it will benefit u to always respond to that pull where doe the pull lead it will guide u to event circumstance and experience that provide an opportunity to express divine gift of beingness and to expose conditioned behaviour pattern formed from an attachment to desired outcome these are distortion of authentic beingness often created by society and causing u to get tight worried angry or frustrated 5 deal with distortion and addictive behaviour the key to dealing with distortion is to realise each conceals divine gift of beingness and to ultimately unveil that instead so for example someone might smoke because it give them the feeling of relaxed completeness we might drink because it make u feel more sociable and confident we might comfort eat because it give u the feeling of contentment alternatively we might get worried stressed or tight around particular issue because we think we need particular outcome the key to overcoming such conditioning is to go within breathe deeply settle into the pregnant pause before the moment is born find our sense of inner completeness and then make space for an authentic act of beingness to arise naturally this is by no mean an easy thing to do but the more we practice it the more we ll realise every moment offer black and white choice give in to conditioning or surrender into the soul in this way we become the master of our own destiny 6 raise our energetic vibration this can be achieved by regulating the denseness of vibration we bring into the body thereby limiting the stimulus that raise our internal metabolic rate so for example if we eat dense processed food polluted with toxin then the body ha to work harder to process them and the extra effort swallow up consciousness or if we pollute our mind with too much clutter or the negativity caused by the judgmentalism frequently expressed through the medium then we tend to tighten inside internal tightness is also heightened by too much computer time over use of electrical gadget and chemical toxin used in household cleaning material the key is to organise our immediate living environment to raise our energetic vibration 7 conduct regular spiritual practice we live in world that de sensitises u and it is therefore of paramount importance that we redress the balance by conducting regular spiritual practice such a daily meditation traditionally meditation is considered a sitting quietly in stillness but it could also happen during movement or breathing what is essential is that we begin to open cleanse and harmonise the chakra system this infuses the light of the soul through our being thus reactivating the seven bodily vehicle of expression also such practice liberates powerful endorphin into the body which counteract the intervention energy they redress the internal balance helping u find greater harmony and peace that we may reactivate the divine downward creative flow read 13 chakras your next spiritual level the resurrection when we re truly connecting to the soul and experiencing it through the seven bodily vehicle it feel like coming home whatever is happening in the external drama we feel like we re in the groove we sense our at one ment with the whole of life sitting on park bench watching the light flickering through the leaf suddenly take on much deeper meaning you find yourself soaring on the thermal of life yearning take hold to return to our true nature we re ready to turn away from society conditioning and find the truth to activate the divine human within when you start fully infusing soul through meditation you ll be taken on magical journey of remembrance of detoxification healing and rejuvenation the seven bodily vehicle are purified reactivated and re energised in short they are resurrected you re acquire those skill so tragically taken from you you once more take on multi dimensional form much greater expanded reality becomes your truth you are reacquainted with your birth right rise divine human by open rise up from openhand on vimeo dear friend humansarefree is and will always be free to access and use if you

requires shift one that feel myself almost cringing to admit involves emotional intelligence this go against all rational logic most people are polite and ll admit to tendency for avoiding conflict especially given the context in which many of these potential debate typically arise came across the following article by accident some time back it immediately resonated with my own experience in wrestling with my own belief but also the belief world view and opinion of people care about and collectively speaking the opinion and view of anyone with pulse who care about financial safety justice and wealth you are m afraid to say mistaken the position you are taking make no logical sense just listen up and ll be more than happy to elaborate on the many many reason why m right and you are wrong are you feeling ready to be convinced whether the subject is climate engineering the middle east or forthcoming holiday plan this is the approach many of u adopt when we try to convince others to change their mind it also an approach that more often than not lead to the person on the receiving end hardening their existing position ed for the subject of money and wealth at the root lie the fear of loss more powerful than the want of profit people will do anything and convince themselves of practically anything to avoid loss fortunately research suggests there is better way one that involves more listening and le trying to bludgeon your opponent into submission little over decade ago leonid rozenblit and frank keil from yale university suggested that in many instance people believe they understand how something work when in fact their understanding is superficial at best they called this phenomenon the illusion of explanatory depth they began by asking their study participant to rate how well they understood how thing like flushing toilet car speedometer and sewing machine worked before asking them to explain what they understood and then answer question on it the effect they revealed wa that on average people in the experiment rated their understanding a much worse after it had been put to the test what happens argued the researcher is that we mistake our familiarity with these thing for the belief that we have detailed understanding of how they work m sure you ve experienced this with the topic of money and currency we use the term interchangeably though they are very different in reality ll never forget the transformation witnessed in bitcoin aficionado arriving from the technological side of thing coming to grip with the store of wealth versus currency usually nobody test u and if we have any question about them we can just take look psychologist call this idea that human have tendency to take mental shortcut when making decision or assessment the cognitive miser theory why would we bother expending the effort to really understand thing when we can get by without doing so the interesting thing is that we manage to hide from ourselves exactly how shallow our understanding is it a phenomenon that will be familiar to anyone who ha ever had to teach something usually it only take the first moment when you start to rehearse what you ll say to explain topic or worse the first student question for you to realize that you don truly understand it all over the world teacher say to each other didn really understand this until had to teach it or a researcher and inventor mark changizi quipped find that no matter how badly teach still learn something explain yourself research published last year on this illusion of understanding show how the effect might be used to convince others they are wrong the research team led by philip fernbach of the university of colorado reasoned that the phenomenon might hold a much for political understanding a for thing like how toilet work perhaps they figured people who have strong political opinion would be more open to other viewpoint if asked to explain exactly how they thought the policy they were advocating would bring about the effect they claimed it would recruiting sample of american via the internet they polled participant on set of contentious s policy issue such a imposing sanction on iran healthcare and approach to carbon emission one group wa asked to give their opinion and then provide reason for why they held that view this group got the opportunity to put their side of the issue in the same way anyone in an argument or debate ha chance to argue their case those in the second group did something subtly different rather than provide reason they were asked to explain how the policy they were advocating would work they were asked to trace step by step from start to finish the causal path from the policy to the effect it wa supposed to have the result were clear people who provided reason remained a convinced of their position a they had been before the experiment those who were asked to provide explanation softened their view and reported

remains and put them under covering of earth away from our home but the house he once shared with his wife and six child had been looted everything from the washing machine and the water tank to cup and saucer and kettle and the home of kenjo neighours lay in ruin broken open by shell and rocket this wa the front line north of hama city whose history lay in the blood of insurrection more than 34 year ago so close to the front line in fact that the fighter bomber were still howling over our head to attack the islamist ahrar al sham nusra all the usual suspect in the next village to the north west the syrian say you can only see their jet that the russian fighter bomber are so fast it impossible to catch them with the naked eye you could make out the spray of anti missile flare that the aircraft released four or five bright star that drifted through the imperial blue sky like firework but then a the plane turned one after the other from their bombing run you could just see them a the sun caught their swept back wing daggering up into the heaven to the south before their bomb exploded with loud hollow sound like two giant wooden plank banging together on the ground amid the soldier sweating tired general turned up steel helmet over his eye marching briskly with his officer through the ruin wanted to know how many of the nusra men had died many many he replied but when asked how many of his syrian soldier had been killed in the broken smashed village of soran his answer came without hesitation we had 42 martyr he said bleakly didn doubt the figure and when soldier tell the truth it mean they are winning but that a lot of men to lose for one dust covered hamlet the syrian army death toll in six year of war is state secret but ve been given reliable figure for the government army fatality in this terrible war around 75 000 these are the dead not the hundred of thousand of wounded soldier expect to die they live by the sword civilian on both side are the innocent whose life should be spared their mortality statistic come from all side including the united nation is it 250 000 or 300 000 a the un now state or 400 000 a the expert in faraway city now

after house in what had been soran had been blown apart some remained their door ajar the bougainvillea still spilling over their concrete wall but always when walked inside there were cupboard torn open by the retreating islamist pile of child clothes and toy and clock and family snapshot scattered across the floor one picture showed baby smiling from cot another husband and wife surrounded by their child the islamist had probably been looking for money hidden in the cupboard but why did the looter want washing machine did they plan to lug this rubbish away in their retreat what happened to those who lived here there wa no doubt of the tragedy of one middle aged man he stood forlornly in the street beside huge bomb crater surrounded by heavy jagged piece of steel casing that lay at his foot am policeman in hama he said my father stayed behind he wa an old man and on the day they left the killer murdered him they shot him at the back of his home and he led me into his father

shank earlier for close quarter stabbing pretorius give up on capturing the zulu and try to shoot him with single shot muzzle loading musket he ha only one chance of hit there is no time to reload in close combat to his horror pretorius see the smoke trailing ball whiz past the zulu ear at the same time the zulu lunge forward causing pretorius horse to stumble backwards throwing the white commander to the ground leaping to his foot he meet the attacking zulu who know he is now on equal term with the white man who can no longer use his magic shooting stick and carry no weapon comparable to the assegai pretorius is now fighting for his life he just manages to sidestep the spear point striking it away with the butt of his gun spinning round the zulu raise his spear high above his head and thrust down a he ha been trained to do in the zulu disciplined army it is blow that will be fatal if it strike home but pretorius see it coming he grab the spear point with his left hand to ward it away from his chest the sharp point cut deeply into his palm embedding itself at an angle that make it impossible for the zulu to pull it out pretorius seizes the zulu by the throat with his free right hand and throw him to the ground in an attempt to strangle him the zulu struggle and with the help of two good hand is about to break free when one of pretorius men come upon the scene he pull the assegai out of the commander hand and plunge it into the zulu side ending the struggle pretorius remount and head back to the boer camp for treatment he is not worried a he know by now that this greatest of all battle between boer and zulu ha already been won the main zulu army ha been broken in two and the river that run along one side of the boer camp is stained red with zulu blood the place and the tributary known previously a the ncome will be renamed blood river pretorius know that the zulu defeat which will include some 3 000 killed on the battlefield is fit revenge for the deception and murder committed by the zulu 10 month earlier prelude to war the great clash between the boer and zulu nation wa not a leftist historian like to claim the result of ruthless white colonialism suppressing an indigenous people it came about because the zulu rejected an extremely reasonable attempt at negotiation by the boer the boer pioneer of dutch french and german descent were the people who opened up much of what wa later to become south africa their first antecedent had landed on the southernmost tip of africa in 1652 only 45 year after the virginia company settled on jamestown island when they arrived in the area now known a cape town white came into contact only with hottentot and bushman a the number of european increased they expanded east and north only meeting their first black tribe the xhosa some 500 mile away on south africa east coast the xhosa were migrating south fleeing the warlike zulu to the north who were engaged in imperialist expansion of their own for just under century white settlement halted at this eastern frontier border formed by the coast and firm xhosa settlement it wa not however time of peace a xhosa were constantly raiding the boer who lived on the border this caused much harm and discontent among the farmer who blamed the dutch ruled colonial government back in cape town for the lawlessness it only added to the border farmer grievance when the british took the cape colony from the dutch in 1806 to prevent the colony from falling into french hand during the napoleonic war it wa vital to control the merchant and naval refitting station on the way to the far east the new colonial master not only started anglicizing the colony when they abolished slavery they offered compensation that amounted to hardly quarter of slave value exasperated by incessant xhosa attack and british attempt to suppress their language and culture group of frontier farmer filled with sense of manifest destiny not seen again until the opening of the american west set forth to the north and the east in movement known a the great trek the trekker they became known a voortrekkers or pioneer only after 1880 bypassed the xhosa in search of new unsettled territory in which they could establish independent boer nation all told it wa only small minority of no more than 12 000 boer who made the trek to the future natal orange free state and transvaal region they traveled in several wave of covered ox drawn wagon much like the conestoga in which american opened the west the boer leader of the time piet retief had written the trekker manifesto in which he spelled out the farmer long held grievance against the british by1836 the boer wagon had crossed the great mountain range into natal in an act of audacity that few thought possible the range the highest in southern africa had been named the drakensberg the dragon mountain because they were said to be impassable retief had identified large piece of uninhabited land to the north of the zulu kingdom which lay open to settlement retief knew that if he wanted the land for his people he could take it unopposed however he wanted to live in peace with his zulu neighbor and before taking possession he opened negotiation with the zulu king dingaan he wanted no misunderstanding between the two people he sent letter to the zulu king explaining why he wanted to speak to him and first visited dingaan capital large circle of reed and grass hut on november 5 1837 retief left the main body of trekker and went to the zulu king capital umgungundhlovo the place of the elephant to negotiate treaty that would allow boer peacefully to settle land adjoining the zulu kingdom dingaan said he would let the boer live in natal if they recovered cattle stolen by tlokwa chieftain retief and his men did so and dingaan agreed to give the land to the boer retief returned to umgungundhlovo on february 3 1838 to finalize the agreement he arrived with 60 volunteer including his own son and three child of other men it wa common for child to accompany their father on expedition of this kind the next day retief and dingaan formally signed treaty the zulu king made his mark by scratching an on the document giving possession of the land to the boer delighted the boer sent scout back to the main encampment to report the successful outcome and made ready to leave a retief and his party were about to saddle up messenger arrived from dingaan inviting the boer party to special celebration to mark the signing retief wa suspicious but did not want to offend dingaan a they had on previous visit the boer stacked their firearm neatly outside the reed wall and entered the royal enclosure unarmed a they ate and drank zulu impi or warrior unit put on dance for the guest according to the account of white missionary who wa present the dancing warrior drew ever closer to the boer till they were just in front of the seated white when the zulu king leaped to his foot and shouted kill the white wizard the impi fell upon the surprised boer some of them drew their hunting knife and tried to fight off the attacker but they were quickly overwhelmed the zulu warrior bound the white with reed rope and dragged them to hlomo amabutho the hill of execution near the zulu capital there they clubbed the boer to death one by one with retief kept until last and forced to watch his son being murdered after retief heart wa extracted and presented to dingaan a proof that the boer leader wa dead the body were left for the vulture in accordance with zulu custom dingaan then gave order for the full might of his army to attack the boer camp the settler had received the message retief had sent earlier and believed everything had gone well they were therefore completely unprepared and badly undermanned the 60 men in retief party were all dead many other men had gone hunting leaving only light guard for the woman and child the boer were so confident there would be peace that they had not even posted sentry just before dawn barking dog aroused the outlying wagon then thousand of zulu warrior attacked the several hundred trekker woman child and old men a they lay sleeping the boer historian gustav preller who interviewed survivor left harrowing account of the aftermath all around dozen and dozen of body baby who had had their head smashed open against the wagon wheel woman dishonored and in some zulu custom their breast cut off n wagon blood filled to height of several inch the life blood of an entire family ebbed out where they lay jan bezuidenhout one of the few young men who had not gone ahead with the retief party grabbed his four month old baby daughter out of her crib and ran off through the undergrowth aving lost his pursuer few mile away bezuidenhout checked for the first time on his daughter in his arm she wa dead single spear stroke had killed her the slaughter became known a the weenen the dutch word for weeping and town of that name still stand near the site of the 600 boer camped in the area zulu killed some 300 including 185 child the rest survived because grazing requirement for their animal meant that the boer camp had to be widely dispersed if dingaan men had scouted more thoroughly found all the encampment and attacked them simultaneously the slaughter would have been far greater pretorius arrives the boer now faced their greatest challenge their camp were full of wounded men orphaned child and widow the zulu had stolen an estimated 25 000 head of cattle and sheep during the weenen slaughter and ammunition wa running low the zulu army might return at any time and they were formidable force a the boer discovered when they launched raid to avenge the massacre on april 6 1838 347 trekker under divided command of piet uys and hendrik potgieter rode into zulu territory only to be defeated by some 7 000 warrior not far from umgungundhlovo in what became known a the battle of italeni this new disaster forced the boer to face reality they had to either abandon their quest for independence and return to the cape colony or find some mean to fight their way through the widow and orphan argued strongly for pushing on they knew that if they fell back to the cape they would have to live on charity whereas if dingaan could be defeated they could at least recover their livestock many boer were also convinced that god favored them and that setback were only test of faith it wa at this moment of indecision that popular lawyer named andries pretorius answered the trekker call for reinforcement and rode into camp with 60 men and brass cannon the boer appointed him commander in chief on november 25 and he immediately began preparing strike against the zulu his mean were few force of only about 468 boer including three scotsman set out on november 27 seeking battle for extra protection the boer column of 64 wagon traveled four abreast instead of the usual single file each night they formed circular defensive formation known a laager pretorius realized that even with two front loading cannon his force wa too weak to defeat the zulu army in an open field he therefore decided to draw the enemy into an attack on the boer encampment each day patrol and scouting party rode ahead sometimes led by pretorius himself to make sure no unexpected surprise were waiting over the horizon on december 9 1838 the boer party reached the zandspruit tributary of the waschbank river it wa here that the boer chaplain sarel cilliers first pledged during his nightly sermon that if god helped them defeat the zulu they and their descendent would celebrate that day in honor of god and that they would build church in commemoration the boer repeated this oath known in afrikaner folklore a the covenant every night until they met the enemy there appeared to be no movement from the zulu side on december 12 pretorius decided to move camp to the buffalo river hoping to provoke the zulu by moving farther into their territory that day he sent out two patrol one under the command of his deputy commandant han de lange and another under the scotsman edward parker this latter group saw action when they came upon small group of zulu they killed the warrior and took the woman prisoner pretorius drew up message for dingaan on white cloth explaining that he wa leading commando to punish the zulu if however dingaan wa willing to cooperate pretorius wrote he wa still willing to make peace generous offer in light of the earlier betrayal he freed the prisoner and told them to give the message to dingaan he received no answer on december 13 the boer spotted zulu and what appeared to be large number of cattle near their camp piet uys had been tricked by such ploy at the battle of italeni zulu warrior crouching behind toughened animal skin shield looked like cattle from distance and uys dropped his guard he wa killed in surprise attack by the cattle pretorius did not make the same mistake and he sent 120 strong mounted unit to investigate the cattle they turned out to be zulu and in the short fight that followed the boer killed eight warrior but suffered no casualty pretorius now suspected that the zulu were preparing for battle on december 15 he moved the boer camp to position alongside the ncome river itself tributary of the buffalo river scouting expedition that day confirmed the presence of two huge zulu army short distance away pretorius prepared for battle his men drew the wagon into d shaped formation one side overlooking large hippopotamus path facing the ncome river another side facing soil erosion ditch and the third side facing the open plain pretorius chose the site to limit the direction from which the zulu could attack the laager wa large enough to contain all the horse and ox the defender tied the wagon together with leather rope and closed off all opening between and below the wagon with pretorius innovation so called fighting gate which were slatted wood fixture through which defender could fire they left two small opening sealed with removable fighting gate so cavalry could leave the laager finally they attached lantern to the end of large ox whip planted upright in the ground these dangled in front of the laager and were to serve a forward lighting during the dark hour when zulu usually attacked zulu captured after the battle said they had believed the light waving in the breeze above the boer camp were spirit and that fear of the spirit kept them from attacking that night battle is joined in pretorius own account of the battle he wrote that a the mist cleared on the morning of december 16 he saw that the boer camp wa completely encircled by ten of thousand of zulu warrior even where the terrain would have made an attack difficult estimate placed the number of zulu at between 15 000 and 25 000 although no official count wa possible whatever the figure pretorius wrote that it wa terrible sight the boer had been ready and armed since two hour before daybreak the two cannon were in position and the fighting gate closed the defender expected to run out of ammunition for the cannon and had stacked up suitably sized stone at strategic point along the perimeter to fire a last resort the boer would fire stone that day the front line of the zulu force were still squatting only about 40 pace from the wagon waiting for the signal to attack pretorius decided to strike first at his signal three burst of fire from the boer gun and two blast from the cannon broke the silence the boer order were to then hold their fire a the billow of gunpowder smoke lifted they saw that the surviving zulu had fled some 500 pace from their former front line leaving behind dozen of dying and dead comrade the boer then heard the noise of the zulu breaking their spear shaft to make them into short stabbing weapon frontal assault wa coming few minute later the zulu force stormed the wagon screaming wildly shield held high and assagai in readiness withering gunfire ripped through the zulu rank and while some managed to reach the wagon they were gunned down before they could cut through the wagon canvass another group of zulu tried to attack from inside the erosion ditch by standing on each others shoulder and scrambling over the edge pretorius ordered cilliers the fighting churchman to see off the attack he led group of men out of the relative safety of the wagon perimeter and they proceeded to kill some 400 zulu one boer philip fourie wa wounded when an assegai struck him in the side the boer then wheeled one of their cannon out of the laager pointed it into the ditch and fired shot that literally blew apart the assaulting party the survivor fled the ditch in disarray this sparked temporary retreat by the zulu and marked the end of the second unsuccessful attempt to break the boer line the wounded boer fourie returned to the wagon circle for treatment a the zulu waited for new order pretorius ordered another burst of cannon fire into their rank provoking spontaneous charge against the wagon although it wa the longest single assault of the nine hour battle it wa utterly defeated a the boer cut down wave after wave of attacker gun barrel got so hot men had to hold them with wet cloth for reloading a the third attack fell back the boer launched their first surprise counterattack a the mobile fighting gate swung open and cavalry unit charged the zulu line shooting from the saddle the boer tried to turn the zulu line to their left desperate zulu resistance which saw hundred more of their number killed stopped the encircling action and the boer horseman rode back to the wagon they regrouped and launched second attempt driving the zulu further away third mounted charge finally broke through the zulu line the boer cavalry then turned and attacked the zulu from the rear pinned between the cavalry and cannon fire from within the wagon circle the main zulu force facing the open plain scattered reserve zulu force tried to cross the ncome river to attack the laager but so many warrior were gunned down that their blood stained the water red pretorius himself then led another cavalry charge from within the laager cut to piece with thousand dead the zulu army which had courageously charged repeatedly against better armed enemy finally broke rank and fled pretorius divided his cavalry into two unit and sent them in pursuit mounted boer killed hundred of warrior during three hour chase it wa during this pursuit that pretorius wa wounded two other boer including fourie suffered nonfatal assegai wound but these were the only boer casualty an estimated 3 000 zulu died on the battlefield and many more died later from wound the aftermath early the next morning pretorius ordered the camp broken and marched the commando straight to the zulu king capital he wa confident the zulu no longer posed any significant threat but he hardly expected the sight that awaited him on december 20 at umgungundhlovo dingaan had fled with his wife and cattle leaving the circular camp of reed hut burning a symbol of the destruction of zulu power on the outskirt of the capital the boer found the skeleton of retief and his men their hand and foot were still bound fast with thong of ox hide wrote cilliers and in nearly all the corps spike a thick a an arm had been forced into the anus so that the point of the spike wa in the chest retief who wa identified by the remains of satin vest he had worn still had leather bag draped over his shoulder bone in it wa the treaty signed by dingaan giving the boer the unoccupied land to the north according to one of the boer who saw it the treaty wa astonishingly well preserved a if it had been left in closed box pretorius men buried retief and his party on christmas day 1838 dingaan fled north but wa captured by rival tribe the swazi earlier he had persecuted the swazi and they murdered him in revenge the new zulu king mpande wa officially installed in 1840 and confirmed the content of the treaty with the boer who established their first republic in southern africa also in 1840 in fulfillment of their covenant the boer built church to mark the blood river victory the battle of blood river entered the afrikaner psyche a divinely inspired victory and december 16 became public holiday in south africa celebrated each year with festival church service and reenactment the battle represented the victory of european civilization over the darkness of africa of christianity over heathen it helped justify white supremacy and the self appointed right of afrikaner to rule over not apart from the black tribe yet the battle of blood river in many way symbolized all that wa wrong with the white settlement of southern africa and why that experiment failed the boer are to be praised for wanting to settle unoccupied land peacefully and for seeking the friendship of neighboring people but neither they nor their descendent understood that demography is the arbiter of nation those who form the majority population of territory will rule that territory no matter how powerful ruling elite may be they will determine it culture and society majority european population will create society that reflects european value and norm majority african population will create society that reflects african norm the boer never understood this even at the battle of blood river they had at least 60 black servant and an indeterminate number of mixed race servant who helped load weapon parker one of the scotsman had more than 100 black servant to the present day the overwhelming majority of afrikaner have black servant who work on farm in factory and in home afrikaner failed to understand that by giving the native population the benefit of european civilization black would grow in number and overwhelm their society the cape colony and the original boer republic which were largely uninhabited by native when they were settled by european are today home to ten of million of african the church of the vow built by the boer in 1840 still stand in the town of pietermaritzburg named after piet retief but pietermaritzburg supposedly the symbol of the boer victory over the zulu is today part of municipality called umgungundhlovo named after dingaan capital it is also the capital of the south african province of kwa zulu natal and it population is more than 95 percent black the church of the vow stand alone graffiti scarred and abandoned in dirty downtown slum it decay illustrates the fatal error made by the victor of the battle of blood river that of ignoring the demographic of race if white had taken possession of those unoccupied land and kept them for themselves alone the history of south africa would have been entirely different if the boer had inhabited and worked their own land rather than rely on black labor the state they created might still be strong and independent today their decision to use non white labor wa critical error that undid all of the sacrifice of the early pioneer the only way to maintain civilization is for the majority to occupy it own land with it own people and to do it own manual labor this law governs the rise and fall of civilization and the victor of blood river ignored it to their cost',\n",

official sent list of possible candidate for national security job one by one the answer from the trump team came back no the reason wa consistent this one had said disparaging thing about mr trump during the campaign that one had signed letter opposing him finally the white house asked mr abrams himself to meet with the president about becoming deputy secretary of state only to have the same thing happen vetoed because of past criticism mr abrams experience ha become case study in the challenge mr trump still face in filling top position month into his presidency mr trump remains fixated on the campaign a he applies loyalty test to some prospective official for their part many republican reacted to what happened to mr abrams with dismay leaving them increasingly leery about joining an administration that cannot get past the past a mr trump brings candidate for national security adviser to meet with him in florida this weekend he presides over government where the upper echelon remain sparsely populated six of the 15 statutory cabinet secretary are still awaiting senate confirmation a democrat nearly uniformly oppose almost all of the president choice even some of the cabinet secretary who are in place may feel they are home alone it is not just secretary of state rex tillerson who ha no deputy secretary much le under secretary or assistant secretary neither do the head of the treasury department the education department or any of the other cabinet department only three of 15 nominee have been named for deputy secretary position defense secretary jim mattis ha deputy only because he kept the one left over from president barack obama administration that doe not even begin to cover the rest of the more than 4 000 appointment that president typically make in some case the trump administration is even going in reverse senior political appointee at the housing department who had already started the job wa fired this past week and marched out of the building when someone discovered his previous statement critical of mr trump the president top latin america official at the national security council wa likewise fired after just week on the job for complaining about internal dysfunction at an discussion at washington research organization according to official who confirmed politico report the state department ha laid off six top career official in recent day apparently out of question about their loyalty to mr trump many tough thing were said about him and by him before last year election mr abrams who served a president ronald reagan assistant secretary of state and president george bush deputy national security adviser said in an interview would have hoped he would have turned toward just hiring the most effective people to help him govern rather than looking back to what we said in that race mr trump ha fallen behind the pace of his last three predecessor both in naming senior official who require senate confirmation and in securing their confirmation according to data compiled by the nonpartisan partnership for public service whereas mr obama had nominated 40 senior official by feb 11 2009 mr trump had named 34 of them a of friday mr obama had 24 confirmed at that point while mr trump ha 14 the trouble assembling an administration reflects the deeper rift between mr trump and the washington establishment of both party businessman with no government experience mr trump catapulted to power on promise to break up the existing system even after he won the republican nomination last year he did little to win over those who had opposed him while his never trump critic within the party kept up steady assault on his qualification and temperament mr trump face other hurdle too with no cadre ready to go from past political service he ha been starting from scratch his team ha been slow to vet candidate and in some case his choice have had trouble with their business background or other matter and democrat have mounted wall of resistance to his nomination slowing the process down the white house did not respond to request for comment but mr trump ha disputed report of trouble the white house is running so smoothly so smoothly he told rally of supporter in melbourne fla on saturday and believe me we inherited one big mess that can tell you the ill will between mr trump and much of the republican establishment work both way many republican who might have agreed to work for the president have been turned off by what they consider his sometimes erratic behavior and the competing power center inside his white house after firing his first national security adviser michael flynn mr trump found that his initial choice for replacement robert harward retired vice admiral would not take the job the problem is that with each successive episode it raise the stake for the next one said peter feaver duke university professor who wa strategic planning adviser to mr bush it going to be hard for the next outsider to accept the national security job and not request the ability to make personnel change richard haass former republican official and now president of the council on foreign relation said mr trump had ruled out much of an entire generation of republican public policy type and alarmed others with his empowerment of stephen bannon his chief strategist to shape national security even some cabinet secretary appear unable to pick their own staff this is unprecedented it untraditional it outside the mainstream said mr haass whose own name had been floated for position and so it just that you be signing on for at minimum tremendous uncertainty and quite possibly for being associated with set of policy you deeply disagree with stuart holliday an ambassador under mr bush said many republican would want to work for mr tillerson or mr mattis however the republican foreign policy bench is not that deep at senior level he said especially if you factor in people who took themselves off the field former senator judd gregg republican of new hampshire said the business veteran that mr trump had enlisted for his cabinet were the most positive thing about his administration so far but he added that the president disregard for advice could complicate his effort to fill post you get the feeling that he still flying by his own experience he said and that got to concern anyone who care about these issue for mr trump the challenge is more pronounced because he and his adviser feel they cannot trust some of the senior career professional still working at the white house or cabinet department leak about mr flynn and mr trump phone call with foreign leader have convinced white house official that they face an opposition within you have new administration that also ha fewer people familiar with the process and system of government including the importance of the vetting process said max stier the chief executive of the center for presidential transition at the partnership for public service you can operate a they did in the campaign context with smaller than usual group it doesn work indeed mr trump failure to vet candidate in advance ha led to some stumble white house scheduler wa fired this past week because of an issue that surfaced in her background check something that normally would have been completed week ago another challenge ha been mr trump implementation of ethic rule that bar white house official from lobbying for five year after they leave the government prompting senior congressional official and lobbyist to demur mr trump ha faulted the democratic minority in the senate for obstructing his choice democrat have voted almost a bloc against many of his nominee breaking with long tradition in which the opposition party largely went along with president selection except in specific case of controversy the democrat are making it very difficult mr trump said at his news conference on thursday this is pure delay tactic despite his own experience one person still urging republican to take job in the administration is mr abrams have been encouraging everybody to go into the government if offered an appropriate position he said

willingness by the united state to deploy force to help it friend and punish it foe people are jubilant in the gulf right now said mohammed alyahya nonresident fellow at the atlantic council who is from saudi arabia what is clear is that trump understands what american power can change and is willing to use it the swift decision by president who had previously shown no interest in entering conflict like syria set mr trump apart from his predecessor far more cautious approach to the war the missile strike on syrian airfield inflicted only minor damage and are unlikely to change the dynamic of complex conflict that rage on local regional and global level on the ground it pit an array of rebel group against the syrian president bashar supporting the rebel are nation like saudi arabia and turkey who oppose mr assad and his ally iran the war ha also entangled russia and the united state and sent shock wave through europe which stream of syrian refugee have fled to but mr trump decision to launch quick strike raised question about whether it would give the involved power pause a they pursue their objective in war that seems to have no end in sight russia and iran who back the syrian government have responded angrily to the strike while ally who criticized president barack obama cautious approach have welcomed the change some ally renewed their call for leadership change in damascus although official in the trump administration did not portray the strike a the start of broader campaign lot of this is an emotional response but nothing about this strike suggests that the fundamental of the syria conflict have shifted said noah bonsey syria analyst with the international crisis group a president mr obama sought to differentiate himself from his predecessor george bush by limiting direct american involvement in middle eastern war that angered some ally israel saudi arabia and others accused him of overlooking aggressive move by iran in order to clinch deal to limit it nuclear program and persian gulf state and turkey were irate when he did not enforce his own red line on the use of chemical weapon in syria by using force against mr assad after an attack in 2013 that killed more than 1 000 people now many who felt that mr obama caution gave green light to mr assad brutality are lauding mr trump for his forcible response to this week chemical attack in khan sheikhoun town in northern syria everyone here in khan sheikhoun is happy it is revenge for the family of the victim said yasser sarmini rebel fighter who wa in the town at the time of the strike trump is more frank and earnest than obama he promised and fulfilled his promise in turkey which ha long backed syrian rebel in their effort to topple mr assad president recep tayyip erdogan told rally that he supported the attack but wanted further action want to say we found this positive a step taken against the war crime the assad regime ha committed with chemical and conventional weapon mr erdogan said is it enough don reckon it is enough he called for the establishment of safe zone inside syria an idea considered but ultimately rejected by the obama administration turkey foreign minister mevlut cavusoglu went further calling in televised speech for leadership change in syria this regime should be removed from syria right away he said the best way to do this is to establish the interim government an interim government without assad in israel which ha kept it distance from the war raging across it northern border prime minister benjamin netanyahu said the strike sent clear message against the spread of chemical weapon israel fully support president trump decision and hope that this message of resolve in the face of the assad regime horrific action will resonate not only in damascus but in tehran pyongyang and elsewhere he said but mr trump action could complicate the pursuit of other american priority including defeating the islamic state russian official who have denied that the syrian government ha retained any chemical weapon condemned the american attack and suspended their agreement with the united state over the use of syrian airspace the russian foreign ministry said on friday russia ha argued that the death in khan sheikhoun on tuesday occurred when bomb hit chemical weapon facility belonging to the rebel so far mr trump ha not clarified whether thursday strike were response to the chemical attack or the start of more direct american involvement he had previously spoken of cooperating with russia against the islamic state and his spokesman sean spicer said just last week that mr assad staying in power wa political reality that we have to accept maha yahya the director of the carnegie middle east center in beirut lebanon said it too early to call this game changer because we don know what the next step will be or if there will be next step m yahya said she had learned of the strike in the company of syrian dissident in washington where some applauded and others stayed silent there were lot of mixed emotion she added they were worried about what this mean yet at the same time incredibly relieved and happy that someone is finally standing up for them against assad some analyst said that even if the strike did not represent major blow to mr assad military ability it could be deterrent by signaling new american assertiveness in the conflict in iran the attack and the swiftness with which it wa executed caught the establishment by surprise most in the crowd at friday prayer said they had heard of the attack only through social medium state television broadcast the reaction of the foreign ministry hour after the strike farshad ghorbanpour an analyst close to the government of president hassan rouhani of iran predicted that the country would take the news seriously they will choose not to be confrontational towards the s and the west mr ghorbanpour said iran will continue

              " 'share on facebook share on twitter it a no brainer that a specie we want to feel good all the time mean who wake up in the morning wanting to feel bad but with the way society bombard u with unrealistic ideal and goal it feel like nearly impossible feat advertisement learn more ve been battling with my brain the past month on whether or not want to look good or feel good trust me know what the right answer is but just can overlook the idea that maybe can have both you can by the way perhaps m just looking at it all wrong there are many different route to happiness and on our journey there we are presented with many road block that either shift u ahead step or really set u back about mile either way the destination will always be there and believe it through these road block that we can learn more about ourselves and our body one thing is for sure while it important to know what our destination is it also important to not fixate on it or even worse not allow it to change when we change you will change during this time even more so it important to focus on the small step to get there so let avoid overwhelming our psyche with doubt 1 look in the mirror optimistically just the other day before getting fully undressed to take shower decided wanted to look at myself in the mirror with my underwear on even put my underwear back on to do this just a wa pulling them up had startling realization that all wa going to do to myself wa judge my body knew that wasn actually wanting to look at myself in the mirror in positive way just wanted to remind myself about what wanted to change after this moment decided that every time looked at myself in the mirror had to say three positive thing about myself wasn going to avoid looking in mirror but rather encourage positive reinforcement with my reflection after all we can always find something negative to say about ourselves so why would perpetuate the insecurity advertisement learn more 2 cleanse your feed at this point in my life ve come to realize how my social medium outlet work or at least how want them to work spend considerable amount of time on instagram and facebook every day so it really important that control what allow myself to be exposed to recently decided to filter my social medium account in an effort to ensure m only seeing content that will benefit me intellectually emotionally and psychologically use facebook strictly for information like article news etc and instagram for inspiration and keeping up with friend do still use facebook for this to degree but limit it to close friend and family started by unfollowing a many people or page that offered me little to no substance you can do this by clicking on the arrow in the top right corner of any post and selecting unfollow also went through my facebook page and changed the setting on whichever one felt gained the most knowledge from by clicking liked and then see first 3 comparing doesn benefit anyone even though instagram is pretty good at making sure you only see the page and people you want to follow it also insanely easy to see content you didn bargain for this can obviously be great in helping you to discover new thing and people but it can also throw you into never ending hole of self doubt from fitness page to fitness page to fitness page sometimes this can be motivating to see other woman and men attaining their fitness goal but most of the time it make u wish we weren so lazy or undisciplined the one thing always remind myself is that there is no sense in comparing we have all led different life that have brought u to certain point in our life it make no sense to compare yourself to 25 year old fitness model when you do not value fitness yourself or are not at the same stage in your fitness journey not to mention all the other factor time money health genetics etc it their job to look that way it not yours 4 read book one terrible habit m in the midst of kicking is how much time spend on my phone right before bed aside from it inhibiting my sleep it also take away time could be spending learning more about myself and the world now an hour or more before bed turn off my wifi and data and turn airplane mode on and lie in bed reading book have already felt significant difference with my eye they don get a dry or feel a strained and have much easier time waking in the morning another good and maybe obvious tip is to read one book before starting another one believe that having multiple book on the go may be stressful to our subconscious mind making u feel like we have unfinished business and making it more difficult to retain information and of course that stress also make falling asleep that much harder 5 ditch the guilt no one ha control over the way we feel except ourselves and far too often we give ourselves daily beating over decision we ve made or didn make you have to be your own best friend spend time with yourself often and treat yourself often the next time you want to buy yourself something you want or want to try something new do it consciously make decision that what you are about to purchase for yourself is gift for whatever reason we are made to feel that we are not worthy of nice thing or to experience moment of zen every week treat yourself whether that be by taking bath eating dessert buying an outfit going for walk or watching play set day night or even hour for you and yourself to go on date treat yourself how you want to be treated overall there are so many way we can feel good about our body and our mind but the best way to truly know what make you feel good is by really tuning in to how your body feel this may seem glaringly obvious but oftentimes we do something because we think it will feel good the next time you have an idea of something you want to do or perhaps you ve done something you expected would make you feel good sit in the moment for while and really listen to your body monitor the way it feel and whether or not you ve created an expectation or if what you re experiencing is authentic trust me you ll know the sacred science follows eight people from around the world with varying physical and psychological illness a they embark on one month healing journey into the heart of the amazon jungle you can watch this documentary film free for 10 day by clicking here if

slaughtered the sacrifice known a the hadi is incumbent on all pilgrim who must donate at least of the meat to the poor modern pilgrim usually have slaughterhouse near mecca do this for them via the local post office how do you know your animal wa sacrificed by text message of course outside saudi post in mina the sprawling tent city where pilgrim live for part of the hajj marwan nabil 22 who is from yemen began to worry when he had not received his confirmation the system is down but don worry it will be done in an hour said faisal postal worker it wa all so neat and tidy not so in humid sweaty slaughterhouse on the edge of mecca men in stained robe hauled flailing sheep into the building one man dragged his prey by it leg and another carried one of the animal on his back butcher in red hacked with curved blade at skinned sheep hanging on hook cleaner in yellow dumped sheep gut into drain under the killing floor nearby men in muddy clothes sat on dirty red carpet watching animal being chopped up outside the slaughterhouse pakistani woman shook an empty plastic bag meat she asked hoping charitable local would oblige for pilgrim who are not strong enough to endure the long trek of the hajj there are men with wheelchair for hire who will push them from site to site ritual to ritual but it not cheap one wheelchair pusher told me he charged older client 200 riyal or about 53 for day asked him how he set his price and if he charged by weight on the third day of the hajj pilgrim throw rock at three stone pillar near jamarat bridge in of ibrahim or abraham stoning the devil a he try to follow god commandment jamarat ha been notorious choke point for hajj crowd that where hundred maybe thousand of pilgrim died last year in crush of people in 2004 my sister wa caught in one of the hajj throng security official this year are trying to limit the number of pilgrim who can go to jamarat at any given time to avoid dangerous backup official have instituted pedestrian road for pilgrim from the tent city of mina to the jamarat building and direction flash in english and arabic to keep people moving collected 49 small rock in an empty water bottle for the ritual and some more experienced pilgrim showed me how to carefully but purposefully throw my stone tip nobody like lefty after throwing my first batch of stone with my left hand wa politely corrected joked that any devil could duck my throw grew up in an observant muslim family in canberra australia but stopped wearing head scarf in college and now at 38 lead largely secular life naturally a reporter came on my first hajj the pilgrimage filled with ritual that is required of every muslim with many question how would people from stunningly different place like inner mongolia bosnia and herzegovina and new jersey interact who get to kiss the rock lodged inside the kaaba the black cube that pilgrim circle seven time what would pray for on the second day atop mount arafat time and place in which our tradition tell u god answer petition where do two million people poop m still working on my list scroll down for video and snapshot but took some time to answer question that reader submitted on nytimes com what is inside the kaaba ha it been rebuilt over the century do men and woman walk around the kaaba at the same time swaroop conjeevaram north royalton ohio are woman and men allowed to circle the kaaba together or are the gender segregated mary ann hall north charleston c only very delegation are allowed in the kaaba and not often there are blurry video online that seem to show it mostly empty save for two pillar an altar incense lamp and plaque on the wall what we can say for sure is what is not there image of the god that arab once worshiped and kept inside the kaaba love the idea that the place muslim must pray to is empty muslim are internalizing in every prayer that the one god they worship cannot be represented in an image and cannot be imagined to the point where the house sanctified to god is empty the kaaba is renovated from time to time but sparingly so out of respect for the structure importance to islam men and woman do walk around the kaaba at the same time in that way it a unique holy site in islam where the sex mix and undertake their rite together what is the connection between the kaaba and allah daan bijdevaate the netherlands muslim believe that the prophet ibrahim the biblical abraham built the kaaba to worship the one true god some think it sits on the site where adam the first human had his own prayer space in all case muslim see it a the oldest house of worship for the one god it is also called beit allah house of god the pilgrim in turn is guest of the house of god are allowed to watch the hajj such a tourist or visitor sarah santiago chile why are not allowed in mecca fabian babich sydney australia are christian welcome to observe the ritual erin bunting aliquippa pa only on the live television broadcast are not allowed to enter the holy site based on the quran chapter 9 verse 28 which say believer verily the polytheist are impure so let them not approach the masjid after this their final year this is so rigidly enforced that there is special highway bypassing the area in any case there no room the saudi government already limit the number of people allowed into mecca during hajj to about two million many country have lottery system to select pilgrim met palestinian man who had applied for seven year and at 72 had worried that he might die before seeing the holy site how is it going with the bathroom situation lynn bender davis calif think the saudi have gone to some effort to try to make bathroom a available a possible nobody ha peed in front of me a happened to member of my family when they came here but we are on the move so much that sometimes have to hold it in for hour luckily we re not eating much heavy food also since my journalist visa make me v p guest of the saudi government m staying in compound where there are clean toilet and shower how accessible are relief station for say heatstroke ahad chowdhury chino calif that wa something worried about lot before came have not seen many medic station but have seen ambulance and hospital also pilgrim are constantly spraying one another with water to avoid overheating and many place have structure that emit fine mist to cool you down do people stay with the people they came with or stay alone or do they also connect with stranger and make new friend ani grosser lenox mass well my mum wa hoping d find husband here usually pilgrim come in delegation and stay with them in the same hotel travel on the same bus and share the same meal except for interview it been hard to meet people because they tend to move in big unit in my news medium delegation there is yemeni woman who look like sweet granny until she flip on her niqab she always smiling and she my favorite do young men and woman try to make friend mo kareem houston don see much mixing and it hard to see where it could happen except perhaps while circulating the kaaba men and woman mostly pray separately and they sleep in separate quarter it also forbidden for even married people to have sex during hajj so m guessing that any premarital mixing which islam already see a sinful would be considered doubly bad saw an ad for the hajj at tour company and one package had animal sacrifice a an option what is the deal with this beth harrison millburn j wish had that option one requirement of the hajj is for each pilgrim to ritually slaughter an animal sheep cow camel or goat at the end if your hajj package doe not have sacrifice option which mean the tour company doe it on your behalf you can also buy coupon here in mecca for slaughterhouse to take care of it pilgrim who do it soon enough receive confirmation by text message that their chosen animal ha been slaughtered and the government undertakes to distribute the meat to the poor around the world am interested to know your inner feeling about bikini and burkini before and after the hajj mohammed basith new york think both bikini and burkinis the swimsuit designed to adhere to islamic modesty code and banned recently by some french beach town are fine find it offensive when any faith including yes islam dictate what woman should wear also find the contemporary secular obsession with woman needing to be thin and to look young to be depressing is there an where one can do the full hajj but with fewer teeming multitude steven adkins aucamville france nice idea but the full hajj can begin only on the 8th of the last month of the islamic calendar the good news is that it a lunar calendar so sometimes hajj is in the winter lovely time to visit this desert plain if you really can handle crowd there is always umrah kind of muslim can do anytime you mainly circle the kaaba and walk between the hill of safa and marwa which are now enclosed within the sprawling and grand mosque get nervous and tetchy in crowd but so far ve done k the fear melt away and at some point you stop caring about the sweat and virus everybody is sharing the pilgrim chant of here am lord were barely audible over the of plastic water bottle squashed underfoot a we jostled toward mount arafat on sunday the greatest day of the annual hajj muslim believe it is when god will answer all sincere prayer offered there a the sun blazed men and boy splashed the crowd gleefully with the last ounce from their bottle some ducked their head under gush from supply tower and few kind soul offered to turn their spray bottle onto stranger face at first wa disappointed to see the mess of bottle and mud cleaning man in bright yellow and green looking on helplessly had thought arafat would be austere and clean but the pilgrim cheery mood brightened my own of course it wa dirty two million people were walking together on hot day to rocky hill and sucking down bottle of water of course the cleaner couldn sweep it up yet he could cause deadly crush if he got in the way of that river of pilgrim so too crunched the bottle tried not to slip let people spray me with water even prayed at the end of the hajj men are required to shave their head and woman to cut lock of hair at the busy barber complex near the grand mosque they ll buzz you with razor disposable or scissors for 4 machine cut is 2 70 sign around the mosque warn pilgrim not to cut hair inside the complex it turn out some people like to i at islam holiest site mean no disrespect when say mecca is well mecca for shopping people have come here to pray but even five time daily leaf time for the glittering gold shop that line ajyad street this year big seller lightweight ring and white rose and yellow bracelet

lighter wallet child hawk velvet prayer rug decorated with image of the kaaba for 2 60 people sell for the inevitable pilgrim who ha lost her shoe somewhere around the grand mosque calling out the

resembled large black crow in their billowing robe double face veil and glove noticed they all wore little ring that looked like miniature pedometer when asked how many mile one woman had walked that day she laughed it turned out the ring were electronic prayer counter muslim often keep track of individual prayer like seek god forgiveness believing that they earn credit for good deed or hasana with each supplication prayer uttered at the grand mosque are said to be worth 100 000 time those said elsewhere one of the woman hanan showed me her counter 266 and it wa only noon then she thrust the device into my hand and told me to keep it so you can always count your prayer politely declined the big and the small for syria for refugee to find home and acceptance that child would go to sleep with full stomach and mother able to love and care for them prayed for my friend mother who ha cancer and tried to remember all the other friend most of them secular who shyly asked me to sneak in word for them right before we had to leave arafat remembered mum making me promise to pray for husband and so did my mum of course ha instructed me to pray for husband a make my first hajj the pilgrimage to mecca required of every muslim also the health of her best friend and the release from jail in egypt of the son of my aunt maid on the second day of the hajj this year sunday sept 11 pilgrim will clamber onto mount arafat to ask for god forgiveness and make specific request by prayer muslim believe that supplication at that place at that time will be answered along with mum list ll be praying for the health of friend mother who is fighting cancer and the continued happiness and health of my family and friend few friend who are secular muslim like me asked that throw in word for them and will god if you are listening peace would be really nice m not so sure about the husband have been asking all the people meet in mecca what they ll be praying for on mount arafat mervat

question his mother siti hayun hj abdul qadi patted him affectionately and said she would ask that her son become good boy in the future good husband especially good son there are no pocket on the ihram that men wear during the hajj the traditional dress consists of just two white sheet draped around their body and it difficult for men and woman to carry bulky bag in tight quarter so the air right above their head become valuable personal real estate ve seen people carrying canteen of zamzam water on their head others balancing their prayer mat like hat and men from afghanistan sudan oman and egypt top themselves with carefully arranged turban that seem to delicately float above their head when wa little girl and we traveled from australia to egypt to visit my mum family remember the enchanting woman with large basket perched on their head walking casually down crowded market street their empty arm swaying freely see some palestinian woman doing the same thing in the west bank and east jerusalem where work a correspondent in the time jerusalem bureau good idea know no border the hajj is hot and grueling and pilgrim flock to the aesra ice cream shop near the grand mosque where there are separate line for men and woman after worship there a treat said arar hafsi 51 an algerian pilgrim giggling met one young woman in niqab her face and body covered in heavy black cloth clutching plastic cup filled with swirl of mango and strawberry she said laughing that maybe she had one after every prayer that five time day is it good asked well she said it all there is know you want to know so woman wearing niqab eats ice cream by filling the spoon then raising her veil just bit and sticking the spoon in her mouth qasim 16 worker interviewed at the shop gave free cup to me and the saudi minder who follows me everywhere under the government rule for journalist covering the hajj the ice cream tasted good also it all there is so a made my first hajj joining million of muslim from around the world on the annual pilgrimage to our holiest place did not have the antibiotic or disinfectant gel my family had insisted carry to ward off what we call the hajj flu did not have proper head scarf or even prayer mat a the call to prayer sounded stood in line of woman on the street leading to the grand mosque and realized would have no clean place to put my head during the full prostration we make in symbolic act of submission to god figured never mind this is the hajj once in lifetime then the woman standing next to me said ve made space for you we had to pray very close together our head were touching on that tiny mat afterward thanked her her name is samira and she is professor in algeria she kissed me on the cheek and said that wa the way muslim should behave and that wa her sister one of the main hajj ritual is to walk seven time around the kaaba islam holiest site my brother and sister who did the hajj year ago had told me about the pigeon that circle seemingly in sync with the pilgrim overhead sign from god perhaps but helped along by the woman selling bird feed to people who flung it joyously into the air around the grand mosque group of nigerian teenager stood in corner calling out zamzam zamzam zamzam and passing out plastic cup of water zamzam is well located within the haram the mosque that surround the kaaba islam holiest site muslim believe god made it bubble up a the second wife of ibrahim abraham in the bible tried to soothe her thirsting child bottle sell for 4 95 on the internet wa spooked after reading an article saying zamzam water had high level of arsenic but in the heat and exhaustion of the hajj it tasted refreshing even stopped in front of an egyptian man spraying people face with the water a small good deed he said he did the same during the 2011 uprising in cairo but wa worried when saw pilgrim returning their empty cup to the nigerian this is how hajj flu spread my favorite passage of the autobiography of malcolm wa when he described the pilgrim being of all race and color it still like that chinese woman showed me her mandarin quran saw woman from uzbekistan who had their national flag sewn onto their head scarf and men with kurdistan emblazoned on their jacket there were pakistani with beard dyed cartoonish red and one guy who know from where in gold sequined hat he looked fabulous it reminded me of the little mosque of my childhood in multicultural canberra australia grew up thinking it wa normal to worship next to muslim from bosnia and vietnam afghanistan and jordan walking around the kaaba wa like canberra writ large there wa something very incredible and lovely about being tiny little human among ten of thousand of other human saying the same prayer and doing the same ritual',\n",
              " 'share this nuclear weapon present the greatest public health and existential threat to our survival every moment of every day yet the united state and world nuclear nation stand in breach of the 1968 nuclear non proliferation treaty which commits these nation to work in good faith to end the arm race and to achieve nuclear disarmament forty eight year later the effort of the nuclear nation toward this goal is not evident and the state of the world is equally a dangerous a it wa during the height of the cold war and arguably more dangerous with current scientific evidence on the catastrophic effect of even limited regional nuclear war this year presidential campaign ha once again done little to focus on the danger of nuclear weapon focusing more on who ha the temperament to have their finger on the button with absolutely no indication of any understanding of the consequence to all of humanity by the use of these weapon even on very small scale in addition to tension between russia and the s in ukraine and syria there is real danger of nuclear war in south asia which could kill more than 2 billion people from the use of just 100 hiroshima size weapon the rest of the world is finally standing up to this threat to their survival and that of the planet they are taking matter into their own hand and refusing to be held hostage by the nuclear nation they will no longer be bullied into sitting back and waiting for the nuclear state to make good on empty promise at the united nation this past week 123 nation voted to commence negotiation next year on new treaty to prohibit the possession of nuclear weapon despite president obama own word in his 2009 pledge to seek the security of world free of nuclear weapon the u voted no and led the opposition to this treaty rather than meet our obligation under international law the u ha proposed by stark contrast to begin new nuclear arm race spending 1 trillion dollar over the next 30 year to modernize and rebuild every aspect our nuclear weapon program job program to end humanity each of the nuclear nation is expected to do the same in rebuilding their weapon program continuing the arm race for generation to come the myth of deterrence is the guise for this effort when in fact deterrence is the principle driver of the arm race for every additional weapon my adversary ha need two and so on and so on to our global arsenal of 15 500 weapon fed up with this inaction and doublespeak the non nuclear nation of the world have joined the ongoing effort of the world ngo health and religious community in demanding an end to the madness led by the international campaign to abolish nuclear weapon ican global partnership of 440 partner in 98 country the international red cross the world health association representing more than 17 million health professional worldwide along with religious community including the catholic church and world council of church they are calling for treaty to ban and eliminate nuclear weapon the effort to ban nuclear weapon ha several parallel to the international campaign to ban landmines led by jody williams recipient of the 1997 nobel peace prize this effort wa dismissed and called utopian by most government and military of the world when it wa launched by nongovernmental organization ngo in 1992 only to succeed in 1997 through partnership public imagination and political pressure resulting in the ultimate political will the nuclear ban movement ha been vigorously fought by the nuclear nation trying desperately to hold onto their weapon and pressuring member of their alliance to hold the line unfortunately these weapon and control system are imperfect during the cold war there were many instance where the world came perilously close to nuclear war it is matter of sheer luck that this scenario did not come to pas by design or accident our luck will not hold out forever luck is not security policy from medical and public health stance based on our current evidence based understanding of what nuclear weapon can actually do any argument for continued possession of these weapon by anyone in untenable and defies logic there is absolutely no reasonable or adequate medical response to nuclear war a with any public health threat from zika to ebola polio hiv prevention is the goal the global threat from nuclear weapon is no different the only way to prevent the use of nuclear weapon is to ban and eliminate them our future depends upon this president kennedy speaking on nuclear weapon before the n security

that the largest party in parliament will remain the party of mark rutte the prime minister with 31 of 150 seat he ha moved rightward in recent month making tougher pronouncement on immigration but steering clear of the xenophobic and borderline racist statement of other party the populist party of geert wilder gained seat but did not perform a strongly a expected exit poll suggested that it wa tied for second place with the conservative party christian democratic appeal and the party democrat 66 each with 19 seat also making relatively strong showing were the green with 16 seat the leftist

rife so all vote tallying will be done by hand democracy is definitely alive said mark bovens political scientist at utrecht university noting the high turnout the nationalist party have won seat compared to 2012 wilder party ha gained seat a ha new party the forum for democracy but their electorate is stable it ha not grown and some of the traditional party have moved in more nationalistic direction taking bit of wind out of his sail you see the same strategy in germany mr bovens noted that an earlier populist movement led by the politician pim fortuyn won 26 seat in 2002 and that mr wilder won 24 seat in 2010 so even if mr wilder party rise to 19 seat from 15 in the current parliament a the exit poll project it will be still lower than the previous mark mr wilder is an

their tradition while we have to change ours m swaghoven said only one interviewee nadine houwes 20 veterinary assistant said she would not vote all politician say something but are not doing it she shrugged alison smale mr wilder is unique in that he ha taken advantage of loophole that allows him to lead party with seat in parliament even though a technical and legal matter his party is an association and is not covered by some of the dutch and european union law that pertains to political party for legal purpose mr wilder is the sole member of his party for freedom everyone else is part of the party association the dutch word vereniging and they are not required to pay due there is no requirement in the netherlands that candidate on the party list for which citizen cast vote need to be party member but every other party in the dutch parliament is organized along traditional line with member paying due by having an association rather than party expert say mr wilder retains control over the party platform and is able to keep much of his financing secret because under dutch law the head of the party must report all income and expenditure to party member and he is the only one only larger sum expenditure over 4 500 euro or about 4 780 and debt over 25 000 euro or about 26 500 need to be disclosed to the government the downside is that he is ineligible for government

              " '2016 election by bar editor and senior columnist margaret kimberley donald trump many evil are manifest and obvious but let stop pretending that some historical line ha been crossed in s political and social relation the dictate of white supremacy are ever present and the number of white people who do anything serious about it are small newly outraged democrat act like they ve never seen fascist there is an ample supply of domestic fascist they are the people who wear police uniform freedom rider how not to protest trump by bar editor and senior columnist margaret kimberley there are many unique characteristic to the donald trump story but the institutional evil that permeate this country persist no matter who sits in the oval office thousand of progressive are taking to the street in opposition to the donald trump presidency after eight year of obama induced slumber they awoke with quite start many of these individual and organization protested a part of the anti war occupy and black life matter movement but others weren concerned about very much until the reality show host became president elect the awful hillary clinton should be inaugurated the 45 th president of the united state because she won the popular vote but for the second time in le than twenty year democrat preferred by the people will instead be an historical footnote if nothing else the electoral college is rightly condemned but where else should protester direct their anger if they are concerned about fascism they could protest police killing or united state government murder committed during numerous intervention abroad they might have risen up against the mass incarceration state the list of outrage that should get people moving is quite long white liberal here in new york city didn care very much when black and brown resident were subjected to nearly one million police encounter mayor bloomberg infamous stop and frisk program wa tailor made opportunity for public anger yet every poll indicated that white people were in favor of this very fascist 21 st century slave patrol those same people are now upset but what exactly ha raised their ire trump is no more hostile to the right of the press than obama wa they say they are concerned about the right of undocumented people but they didn say much when obama acted a the deporter in chief the so called muslim registry of men from 25 country under the auspex of the nseers program lasted from 2002 to 2011 that is to say during two year of the obama administration they may be concerned about climate change and trump promise to end america participation in the most recent climate agreement but that agreement allows for rise in carbon production and thus in world temperature they would have been smarter to challenge the phony climate change process itself they say they are afraid that trump will muzzle the press his shouting match with network executive should not be cause for alarm eventually they ll start saying good thing about him so he wa foolish to be so hostile but he is no more hostile to the right of the press than obama wa when he used the espionage act to punish leaker and whistle blower many of the now distraught progressive didn say much so what ha gotten progressive so angry there is nothing new about the so called alt right movement there is always way to brand white nationalism they may be the tea party one day and alt right the next but it all amount to the same thing the dictate of white supremacy are ever present and the number of white people who do anything serious about it are small if the sight of naziesque salute to trump are upsetting just keep in mind that there is an ample supply of domestic fascist they are the people who wear police uniform they may not hail trump or anyone else but they kill three people in this country every day barack obama and eric holder quite literally kept thousand of black people in jail who could have been freed donald trump should be given credit for providing so much low hanging fruit his appointment of jefferson beauregard session to the post of attorney general provides ready made ingredient for fear and anger session wa once denied federal judgeship in part because of racist remark directed at black attorney and who can ignore the glorification of the confederacy in his name but what did obama and his two black attorney general do there were no prosecution of killer police that fact is curious one in the age of murder caught on video the obama justice department argued against giving the right to request resentencing for those convicted during the year of draconian drug crime prosecution barack obama and eric holder quite literally kept thousand of black people in jail who could have been freed it is difficult to take protester seriously when they won even direct their anger at the party which displayed such gross incompetence during the recent campaign the inability to defeat the man who seemed so unsuited to the presidency should stir anger towards the people whose hubris brought him to the white house there is always need to engage in struggle whether republican or democrat is president there are many unique characteristic to the donald trump story but the institutional evil that permeate this country persist no matter who sits in the oval office we can gauge the true level

once proposed law ha passed both house of parliament it make it way to the palace for approval which is called royal assent the most recent british monarch to refuse to provide royal assent wa queen anne back in 1708 royal assent is different than queen consent in which the queen must consent to any law being debated in parliament that affect the monarchy interest such a reforming the prerogative or tax law that might affect the duchy of cornwall for example without consent the bill cannot be debated in parliament queen consent is exercised only on the advice of minister but it existence provides the government with tool for blocking debate on certain subject if bill are tabled by backbench rebel or the opposition it ha been exercised at least 39 time according to document released under the freedom of information act including one instance in which the queen completely vetoed the military action against iraq bill in 1999 private member bill that sought to transfer the power to authorise military strike against iraq from the monarch to parliament the guardian reported in 2013 she can create lord the queen ha the power to appoint lord who can then sit in parliament the upper house in britain legislative system like many other power this is exercised only on the advice of elected government minister she doesn have to pay tax but she doe anyway the queen doe not have to pay tax but she ha been voluntarily paying income tax and capital gain tax since 1992 the queen ha the power to form government unlike the queen prime minister david cameron doesn literally sit on throne rob stothard getty image hbo bi the queen previously wielded the power to dissolve parliament and call general election but the fixed term parliament act put an end to that in 2011 now two third vote in the common is required to dissolve parliament before five year fixed term is up she doe still play part after an election however when she call on the mp most able to form government to do so this caused some worry ahead of this year general election it once looked a if the conservative might not have majority but would be the largest party and would try to form government meanwhile it wa feasible that labour could form majority despite having fewer seat by entering into coalition with multiple other party in this situation the queen would have been stuck between rock and hard place every year she open parliament with the queen speech which lay out the government plan but to give david cameron speech would arguably be to tacitly endorse his government while staying away would send the opposite message at one point the time wa told by source that she planned to stay away if cameron failed to secure enough mp but the palace later had an about face royal source confirmed she would lead proceeding even if there wa risk the speech would be overthrown the following week because the tory had failed to muster enough backing from smaller party the time subsequently reported she ha knight sure they no longer ride around on horseback wooing maiden with their tale of valour but britain still retains knight like lord they are appointed by the queen and she knight them personally knighthood are typically given to figure who have made particular contribution to british society whether in business the art the military or elsewhere after terry pratchett wa knighted the legendary fantasy author forged himself special sword using piece of meteorite the individual knighted are decided by minister the bbc report who present her with list of nominee each year for her approval she is exempt from freedom of information request all information about the royal family is exempt from freedom of information request the exemption wa made after legal battle between the guardian and the government to have letter from prince charles sent to whitehall minister made public the so called black spider memo were recently released but the change mean the same can happen in the future she can ignore or overrule ministerial advice in grave constitutional crisis while the overwhelming majority of the queen prerogative power are devolved to her minister there is one exception that allows her to wield power herself only in grave constitutional crisis the sovereign can act contrary to or without ministerial advice with no precedent in modern time it not clear what would actually constitute this but the possibility remains the queen hold the ability to fire the entire australian government a the head of state in australia the queen ha certain power over the government in 1975 for example the queen representative in the country at the time gov gen sir john kerr fired the prime minister in response to government shutdown kerr appointed replacement who immediately passed the spending bill to fund the government max fisher wrote in the washington post three hour later kerr dismissed the rest of parliament then australia held election to restart from scratch and they haven had another shutdown since in addition to the uk and australia the queen is also the head of state in antigua and barbuda the bahamas barbados belize canada grenada jamaica new zealand papua new guinea saint kitts and nevis saint lucia saint vincent and the grenadine solomon island and tuvalu all the above are commonwealth realm or former british colony the british sovereign retains the position she hold in the united kingdom that of head of state a in britain this is largely ceremonial role from day to day she the head of religion queen elizabeth ii is the head of the church of england britain state religion first established after king henry viii split away from the catholic church in rome in the 16th century her formal title is defender of the faith and supreme governor of the church of england and she also ha the power to appoint bishop and archbishop a with many of her other power however this is exercised only on the advice of the prime minister who himself take advice from church commission an interesting side effect of this is that the sovereign must be confirmed member of church of england catholic and those of other religion may not ascend to the british throne if prince charles converted to islam for example he would be unable to become king after queen elizabeth ii dy she get to give away special money to the elderly maundy money is special kind of silver coin the queen give away to pensioner every year at uk cathedral every easter in special ceremony the number of recipient corresponds with the sovereign age this year for example she will be 89 when easter roll around so she will give maundy money away to 89 pensioner the coin are technically legal tender despite coming in unconventional 3 penny and 4 penny denomination but given the coin rare status they tend not to enter general circulation she also immune from prosecution all prosecution are carried out in the name of the sovereign and she is both immune from prosecution and cannot be compelled to give evidence in court in theory the sovereign is incapable of thinking or doing wrong legal scholar john kirkhope told business insider however barrister baroness helena kennedy qc told the bbc in 2002 that nowadays that immunity is questionable although civil and criminal proceeding cannot be taken against the sovereign a person under uk law the queen is careful to ensure that all her activity in her personal capacity are carried out in strict accordance with the law according to official site of the monarchy if the monarch did commit grievance offence he or she would almost certainly be forced to abdicate there is at least one precedent of the court prosecuting the sovereign in the 17th century king charles wa tried for treason following the english civil war he said no earthly power can justly call me who am your king in question a delinquent the court disagreed and had him executed the queen ha the right to be consulted to encourage and to warn her minister assuming no grave constitutional crisis the queen input into the legislative process is supposed to be limited in real term to the right to be consulted to encourage and to warn her minister advice delivered via meeting with the prime minister the queen also ha certain historic right and privilege john kirkhope lawyer who successfully campaigned to have detail of queen consent made public provided business insider with list of some of the stranger right the queen still hold hungerford ha to present red rose to the sovereign in exchange for it fishing and grazing right the duke of atholl must pay by way of rose whenever the sovereign call this most recently happened during the reign of queen victoria so it unclear whether the rose ha to be any particular colour if the sovereign pass near kidwelly castle in wale the tenant ha to provide bodyguard in full armour this is complicated slightly by the fact the castle is ruin the marquis of ailesbury owns savernake forest and is required to produce blast on hunting horn should the sovereign pas through the forest this last happened in 1943 similarly the owner of dunlambert castle in northern ireland ha to produce blast on an ancient bugle and lastly many landowner must also pay quit rent kind of tax on their property paid to the monarch some are pretty unusual the owner of sauchlemuir castle must set out three glass of

gloucester pay for it holding of crown land by providing an enormous eel pie great yarmouth must provide hundred herring baked in 24 pasty to the sheriff who then sends them to the lord of the manor

place would be health law that would be far more oriented to the free market and would make change to vast part of the american economy the house republican bill would roll back the expansion of medicaid that ha provided coverage to more than 10 million people in 31 state reducing federal payment for many new beneficiary it also would effectively scrap the unpopular requirement that people have insurance and eliminate tax penalty for those who go without the requirement for larger employer to offer coverage to their employee would also be eliminated people who let their insurance coverage lapse however would face significant penalty insurer could increase their premium by 30 percent and in that sense republican would replace penalty for not having insurance with new penalty for allowing insurance to lapse house republican leader said they would keep three popular provision in the affordable care act the prohibition on denying coverage to people with condition the ban on lifetime coverage cap and the rule allowing young people to remain on their parent health plan until age 26 republican hope to undo other major part of president barack obama signature domestic achievement including tax credit that help million of american buy insurance tax on people with high income and the penalty for people who do not have health coverage medicaid recipient entitlement to

require more health care in late change the plan reduces the tax credit for individual with annual income over 75 000 and married couple with income over 150 000 republican did not offer any estimate of how much their plan would cost or how many people would gain or lose insurance the two house committee plan to vote on the legislation without having estimate of it cost from the congressional budget office the official scorekeeper on capitol hill but they did get the support from president trump that they badly need to win house passage obamacare ha proven to be disaster with fewer option

for more than 70 million people the federal government would pay different amount for different category of beneficiary including child older american and people with disability the bill would also repeal subsidy that the government provides under the affordable care act to help people pay deductible and other cost for insurance purchased through the public marketplace eliminating these subsidy

affordable care act and improve the nation health care system on capitol hill lawmaker and their aide are waiting to see whether he us his platform twitter account and all to press reluctant republican to get behind the house plan the new version of the house republican bill make several change to earlier draft of the legislation it drop proposal to require employee with health insurance

worker congress had already delayed this cadillac tax despised by employer and labor union alike by two year to 2020 the new legislation would suspend the tax from 2020 through 2024 house republican would offer tax credit to help people buy insurance if they did not have coverage available from an employer or government program under earlier version of the bill the tax credit increased with

apology and you can get that patrick coughlin another of the plaintiff lawyer said at court hearing on thursday m simpson lawyer gary friedman argued in court on thursday that it wa not fair for the case to reach the point of settlement and say we re not giving you the chance to opt out when judge curiel reiterated during the hearing that jury trial could lead to le favorable result mr friedman said that is risk analysis that sherri simpson ha the right to make it is unclear if m simpson will appeal and mr friedman did not return message seeking comment in court filing last week mr trump lawyer asked the judge to give final approval to the settlement mr trump wa motivated to agree to the sweeping deal because it would resolve the claim and avoid trial his lawyer did not respond to request for comment mr trump rebutted the fraud claim during his presidential bid at one point questioning judge curiel impartiality based on his mexican heritage he pointed to positive review of the program and vowed to reopen the university after what he said would be victory at trial his political opponent seized on the allegation and angry former student including m simpson spoke out painting mr trump a huckster who had conned ordinary people for personal profit after his election in november mr trump reversed course and agreed to pay 25 million to resolve the litigation he did not admit fault and he maintained in post on twitter after the settlement announcement that he did not have the time to go through long but winning trial on trump the case wa scheduled to go to trial late last year setting up situation in which mr trump would have probably had to testify during his transition to the white house at trial mr trump would have faced ream of evidence about the business practice

surprised and disappointed that m simpson objected to the settlement fearing that it would delay payment to other student for month if not year judge curiel who ha overseen the case for the last four year said at the hearing thursday that the amount of money the plaintiff would recover in the settlement wa extraordinary he said there would be significant hurdle to reaching similar settlement during trial m simpson lawyer argued that 2015 notice to student about the case gave the impression that they would have an opportunity to be excluded from settlement at later date the lawyer say that it wa abundantly clear that student were required to opt out in 2015 and that m simpson lawyer mischaracterized the notice judge curiel wrote in his decision that there is no blanket rule that due process requires opportunity in 2010 m simpson who is lawyer herself spent about 19 000 on trump university program after the agreement wa announced she submitted claim to partake in the settlement before filing the objection in an interview earlier this week m simpson said she hoped her objection would not blow up the settlement but she said she believed she could fare better at trial for him to go out there and say well didn do anything wrong it disgusting she said want an apology',\n",

opioid crisis claire bernish october 31 2016 8 comment congress would rather protect the profit of pharmaceutical company than the health of those addicted to dangerous opioid drug say former head of the dea responsible for preventing abuse of medication joseph rannazzisi former deputy assistant administrator at the s drug enforcement agency asserts big pharma and it lobbyist have stranglehold on legislator in congress and have engineered the protection of 9 billion per year industry over the health of american citizen according to report from the guardian congress would rather listen to people who had profit motive rather than public health and safety motive he said according to the outlet a long a the industry ha this stranglehold through lobbyist nothing going to change rannazzisi explained lobbyist have spent million thwarting legislative and policy effort to provide guideline for reducing the prescribing of opioid medication closely related to heroin and helped limit the dea power to discipline those who dispense unusually high dosage of the same pharmacist himself rannazzisi severely criticized lawmaker he claim hold double standard publicly vowing to combat the opioid epidemic while essentially working on behalf of pharmaceutical company to ensure the industry profit these congressman and senator who are using this because they are up for re election it a sham he told the guardian the congressman and senator who are championing this fight the one who really believe in what they re doing their voice are drowned out because the industry ha too much influence with the unique insight of having been an insider rannazzisi excoriated the duplicity evidenced between legislator public lamentation of addiction and death from the opioid crisis during election year and private effort to protect drugmakers from liability and he would know according to rannazzisi linkedin profile a chief of diversion he had been tasked with oversight and control of all regulatory compliance inspection and civil and criminal investigation of approximately 1 6 million dea registrant but if the standard are lowered by congress to allow greater leeway in prescribing opioids the threshold of criminality is raised a the guardian point out legislation to fight the opioid epidemic comprehensive addiction and recovery act did in fact pas in july but partisan controversy erupted when republican failed to provide funding to give the law sharp teeth democrat then issued report titled dying waiting for treatment in response which likened the republican response to the opioid crisis to using piece of chewing gum to patch cracked dam indeed the report sharply criticized the bill equating it policy to empty promise for the lack of financial follow through a the washington post detailed in report earlier this month the dea launched an aggressive campaign to rein in distribution of opioids by pharmaceutical manufacturer to illegal pill mill and corrupt pharmacy who cared little whether the drug wound up on the street headed by rannazzisi the office of diversion control sent investigator into the field and began issuing hefty fine and filing lawsuit against the distributor responsible for the proliferation of opioids on the street but the disproportionately powerful pharmaceutical industry fearing potential significant loss in profit fought back hard according to the post the deputy attorney general summoned rannazzisi to meeting in 2012 concerning the case of two unnamed major drug company that meeting wa to chastise me for going after industry and that all that meeting wa about the now retired dea official told the post then in 2014 came what constituted hand out to the pharmaceutical industry by the department of justice and congressional legislator the ensuring patient access and effective drug enforcement act legislation initiated by the healthcare distribution management association the industry group representing distributor at the heart of the controversy an analysis of lobbying record by the post found the healthcare distribution alliance spent 13 million lobbying house and senate member and their staff on the legislation and other issue between 2014 and 2016 rannazzisi argued his case to congressional staffer in phone conference in july 2014 and recalled telling them this bill pass the way it written we won be able to get immediate suspension order we won be able to stop the hemorrhaging of these drug out of these bad pharmacy and these bad corporation stunned at the massive and ultimately successful effort to take the bite out of dea attempt to hold distributor and drugmakers responsible for their role in an epidemic estimated to take 19 000 life every year rannazzisi likened the legislation to free pas for legal drug pusher this doesn ensure patient access and it doesn help drug enforcement at all he told the guardian what this bill doe ha nothing to do with the medical process what this bill doe is take away dea ability to go after pharmacist wholesaler manufacturer or distributor this wa gift gift to the industry he added after heading the diversion office for decade rannazzisi retired in 2015 likely disgusted over legislator dedication to the legal drug industry rather than the people whose interest they re ostensibly obligated to protect the bill passed because big pharma wanted it to pas he told the guardian in no uncertain term the dea is both an enforcement agency and regulatory agency when wa in charge what tried to do wa explain to my investigator and my agent that our job wa to regulate the industry and they re not going to like being regulated big pharma relies overwhelmingly on lobbyist filling the coffer of politician to ensure they ignore the crisis gripping the nation a the center for public integrity found the guardian noted purdue pharma at the heart of the epidemic for it highly addictive drug introduced in the late 1990s oxycontin spent breathtaking 740 million in the last ten year on congressional lobbying effort however big pharma power to influence policy and legislation extends far beyond simple but effective lobbying the government run interagency pain research coordinating committee iprcc ha been accused by sen ron wyden of being tool to weaken cdc guideline for limiting overprescribing of opioids wyden wrote to secretary of health and human service sylvia burwell of his concern the iprcc had been staffed with expert with conflict of interest for their close tie to big pharma including scientist with 1 5 million endowment from purdue reported the guardian you ve got panel that certainly got fair number of people that have vested interest in this problem of overprescribing that something you ve got to root out wyden asserted the role of the pharmaceutical company on these advisory panel trouble me greatly science is getting short shrift compared to the political clout of these influential interest family of countless addict and victim of the opioid industry would undoubtedly find the direct influence of big pharma pro opioid cash appalling yet it continues to this day policy and legislation have not yet been given the appropriate funding needed to effectively combat the problem which swirl out of control while politician and drugmakers reap blood tainted profit corporation have no conscience rannazzisi flatly told the guardian unfortunately with my job wa the guy who had to go out and talk to family that lost kid if one of those ceo went out there and talked to anybody or if one of those ceo happened to lose kid to this horrible horrible domestic tragedy we have d bet you they change their mind when you sit with parent who can understand why there so many pharmaceutical out in the illicit marketplace and why isn the government doing anything well the dea wa doing something unfortunately what we re trying to do is thwarted by people who are writing law share google skyp0ckets you know even if pharma head talked to the family of someone who lost loved one to opiod addiction or had family member suffer that fate don think it would change them in the least these people who are hard wired to accumulate massive amount of wealth are usually somewhere between sociopathic and psychopathic this is why it is very difficult for people to trust medicine and in many case the doctor who dispense it

the country it not the cost of pharmaceutical a much a the enablement of opioid addiction in the name of profit that is disturbing purdue pharma had an opportunity to change their formulation of oxycontin long ago to make their drug nonaddicting but they chose not to according to chasing the scream if that true and so far no one ha denied the assertion then what do we have here this is

police let consider the initial position asked about aleppo in an october debate with clinton trump said it wa humanitarian disaster but the city had basically fallen clinton he said wa talking in favor of rebel without knowing who they were the rebel fighting assad in western syria include nationalist fighting under the free syrian army banner some of them trained in cia backed program and jihadist such a the group formerly known a the al qaeda linked nusra front the obama administration through the cia led by saudi asset john brennan fed weapon training and billion of dollar to moderate rebel these then turned around and either gave the cia gift to al qaeda in syria aka jabhat al nusra or joined it themselves the scheme wa no secret at all and russia a well a syria pointed this out several time the russian foreign minister lavrov negotiated with the s secretary of state kerry who promised to separate the moderate rebel from al qaeda but kerry never delivered instead he falsely accuse russia of committing atrocity that never happened the cia kept the upper hand within the obama administration and continued it nefarious plan that changed the day the president elect trump set foot into the white house while obama met trump in the oval office new policy prepared beforehand were launched the policy were held back until after the election and would likely not have been revealed or implemented if clinton had won the s declared that from now on it will fight against al qaeda in syria president obama ha ordered the pentagon to find and kill the leader of an al qaeda linked group in syria that the administration had largely ignored until now and that ha been at the vanguard of the fight against the syrian government s official said that shift is likely to accelerate once president elect donald trump take office possibly in direct cooperation with moscow s official who opposed the decision to go after al nusra wider leadership warned that the united state would effectively be doing the assad government bidding by weakening group on the front line of the counter assad fight defense secretary ashton carter and other pentagon leader initially resisted the idea of devoting more pentagon surveillance aircraft and armed drone against al nusra ash carter is together with john brennan the major anti russian force in the obama administration he is u weapon industry promoter and the anti russia campaign which help to sell s weapon to nato ally in europe is largely of his doing he saw al qaeda in syria a welcome proxy force against russia but obama ha now shut down that policy we are not yet sure that this is for good but the above washington post account is not the only signal the s department of the treasury office of foreign asset

in 2014 to vatican conference where he expounded on islam populism and capitalism but for all the examination of those remark passing reference by mr bannon to an esoteric italian philosopher ha gone little noticed except perhaps by scholar and follower of the deeply taboo thinker julius evola the fact that bannon even know evola is significant said mark sedgwick leading scholar of traditionalist at aarhus university in denmark evola who died in 1974 wrote on everything from eastern religion to the metaphysics of sex to alchemy but he is best known a leading proponent of traditionalism worldview popular in and alternative religious circle that belief progress and equality are poisonous illusion evola became darling of italian fascist and italy terrorist of the 1960s and 1970s looked to him a spiritual and intellectual godfather they called themselves child of the sun after evola vision of new order that he called the solar civilization today the greek party golden dawn includes his work on it suggested reading list and the leader of jobbik the hungarian nationalist party admires evola and wrote an introduction to his work more important for the current american administration evola also caught on in the united state with leader of the movement which mr bannon nurtured a the head of breitbart news and then helped harness for mr trump julius evola is one of the most fascinating men of the 20th century said richard spencer the white nationalist leader who is top figure in the movement which ha attracted white supremacist racist and element in the day after the election mr spencer led washington conference in chant of hail trump but he also invoked evola idea of prehistoric and spirituality referring to the awakening of white whom he called the child of the sun mr spencer said it mean tremendous amount that mr bannon wa aware of evola and other traditionalist thinker even if he hasn fully imbibed them and been changed by them he is at least open to them he said he at least recognizes that they are there that is stark difference to the american conservative movement that either wa ignorant of them or attempted to suppress them mr bannon who did not return request for comment for this article is an avid and reader he ha spoken enthusiastically about everything from sun tzu the art of war to the fourth turning by william strauss and neil howe which see history in cycle of cataclysmic and change his awareness of and reference to evola in itself only reflects that reading but some on the consider mr bannon door through which evola idea of hierarchical society run by spiritually superior caste can enter in period of crisis evolists view his ship a coming in said prof richard drake at the university of montana who wrote about evola in his book the revolutionary mystique and terrorism in contemporary italy for some of them it ha been long time coming it the first time that an adviser to the american president know evola or maybe ha traditionalist formation said gianfranco de turris an evola biographer and apologist based in rome who run the evola foundation out of his apartment if bannon ha these idea we have to see how he influence the politics of trump he said march article titled an establishment conservative guide to the in breitbart the website then run by mr bannon included evola a one of the thinker in whose writing the origin of the alternative right could be found the article wa by milo yiannopoulos the provocateur who is wildly popular with conservative on college campus mr trump recently defended mr yiannopoulos a symbol of free speech after demonstrator violently protested his planned speech at the university of california berkeley the article celebrated the youthful internet troll who give the movement it energy and who motivated by common and questionable sense of humor use and racially charged meme in typically juvenile but undeniably hysterical fashion it hard to imagine them reading evola the article continued they may be inclined to sympathize to those cause but mainly because it annoys the right people evola who ha more than annoyed people for nearly century seems to be having moment when started working on evola you had to plow through italian said mr sedgwick who keep track of traditionalist movement and thought on his blog traditionalist now he available in english german russian serbian greek hungarian first saw evola boom and then realized the number of people interested in that sort of idea wa booming born in 1898 evola liked to call himself baron and in later life sported monocle in his left eye brilliant student and talented artist he came home after fighting in world war and became leading exponent in italy of the dada movement which like evola rejected the church and bourgeois institution evola early artistic endeavor gave way to his love of the german philosopher friedrich nietzsche and he developed worldview with an overriding animosity toward the decadence of modernity influenced by mystical work and the occult evola began developing an idea of the individual ability to transcend his reality and be unconditionally whatever one want under the influence of rené guénon french metaphysicist and convert to islam evola in 1934 published his most influential work the revolt against the modern world which cast materialism a an eroding influence on ancient value it viewed humanism the renaissance the protestant reformation and the french revolution all a historical disaster that took man further away from transcendental perennial truth changing the system evola argued wa not question of contesting and polemicizing but of blowing everything up evola ideal order professor drake wrote wa based on hierarchy caste monarchy race myth religion and ritual that made fan out of benito mussolini the dictator already admired evola early writing on race which influenced the 1938 racial law restricting the right of jew in italy mussolini so liked evola 1941 book synthesis on the doctrine of race which advocated form of spiritual and not merely biological racism that he invited evola to meet him in september of that year evola eventually broke with mussolini and the italian fascist because he considered them overly tame and corrupted by compromise instead he preferred the nazi s officer seeing in them something closer to mythic ideal they also shared his mr bannon suggested in his vatican remark that the fascist movement had come out of evola idea a mr bannon expounded on the intellectual motivation of the russian president vladimir putin he mentioned julius evola and different writer of the early 20th century who are really the supporter of what called the traditionalist movement which really eventually metastasized into italian fascism the reality historian say is that evola sought to infiltrate and influence the fascist a mr sedgwick put it a powerful vehicle to spread his idea in his vatican talk mr bannon suggested that although mr putin represented kleptocracy the russian president understood the existential danger posed by potential new caliphate and the importance of using nationalism to stand up for traditional institution we the west mr bannon added really have to look at what he talking about a far a traditionalism go particularly the sense of where it support the underpinnings of nationalism a mr bannon suggested in his speech mr putin most influential thinker is aleksandr dugin the ultranationalist russian traditionalist and writer sometimes called putin rasputin an intellectual descendant of evola mr dugin ha called for genuine true radically revolutionary and consistent fascist fascism and advocated theory of eurasianism which ha provided philosophical framework for mr putin expansionism and meddling in western european politics mr dugin see european traditionalist a needing russia and mr putin to defend them from the onslaught of western liberal democracy individual liberty and materialism all evolian bêtes noires this appeal of traditional value on populist voter and against elite the union and centralized government in the united state a mr

grady my mom k grammy and my aunt nancy agreed to his choice including stay in le pavillon when heard about this may have tilted my head like dog when it hears weird noise when did kid suddenly acquire travel planning skill m pretty sure the first time picked hotel wa when met up with my girlfriend in england at age 23 actually she probably picked it but time have changed the general concept of your child influencing your vacation said karen cicero travel editor at parent magazine whether helping pick the destination or planning part of the trip is trend m skeptical when people use the but she pointed to 2015 survey of 540 parent by yougov for homeaway the vacation rental site showing that millennial parent are more likely to let their child age 6 to 18 pick destination themselves than child of older parent it make sense trip planning these day take place mostly online and child know thing or two about the internet considering that leo shop for sneaker and jacket online looking for deal to convince his parent the jump to hotel doesn seem drastic m cicero said that social medium also played role my daughter is 13 and if you scroll through her instagram feed you ll see pic of her friend vacation it get kid excited and give them idea if you think back to even 10 year ago school ended and you didn find out where your friend had gone until you went back involving child ha benefit beyond experience what this highlight is the importance of getting said rainer jenss the president and founder of the family travel association lot of parent don consider getting their kid involved in the planning process dictate it to them and sometimes make assumption about what would make the kid happy that can lead to choice like disney world or cruise but if kid are involved in the

expensive so tried to find place that wa warm and not too expensive that ended up being new orleans he checked weather app to make sure it wouldn be too cold the hotel wa trickier he knew his parent

pool he went to lepavillon com and noted that the hotel wa short stroll to the french quarter and he didn forget the older generation it had kind of french name so it sounded like grammy might like it curious if he wa on target emailed my father peter kugel who confirmed that his wife might be swayed by french moniker he signed the email pierre and cc ed her some expert caution that while involving child in planning is good there are no precise guideline parent should set limit appropriate to their own child allow me to interpret not every is a awesome a my nephew younger kid and some teen don necessarily have all the tool to plan trip in way that would make everyone happy said mark bertin developmental pediatrician in pleasantville y but a long a you re aware of what your child really capable of you could even involve younger child little bit maintaining veto power is but so is setting boundary to avoid having to use it perhaps by preselecting option for child to choose among if they make choice that is not practical it put you at loggerhead said dr karl neumann the pediatrician behind kidstraveldoc com but for child who can handle it open planning encourages them to consider others preference that wa challenge when maddie bates 15 of sterling va wa put in charge along with her brother tyler 20 of the yearly family vacation also for group of six greece wa their pick

who is the reading relaxing type her aunt philippa hughes is into art stuff maddie research method led her away from review site and toward blogger who had written narrative on trip to greece it wa lot better than reading review on tripadvisor she said because you knew what they were doing and how they were feeling when they went to each place she also got tip from friend to encourage family feedback the two sibling posted suggested activity on travefy which allows collaborative trip planning but up to few day before departure their father and aunt had barely meddled not so maddie

is low on the hierarchy of her traditional vietnamese family usually don plan anything just go with the flow she said it nice to be the one planning rather than going on trip and being like don know what m doing she sounded more confident in her choice at 15 than leo did at 12 there wa lot of pressure because if the hotel ended up being junky it would be my fault he said but got sense of pride

small circle of commie hunter out there we all have very long memory and we take it very personally when one of our own is treated like this oleg back in my soviet dissident day when wa collecting

semitic environment created by the left alliance with islamic terrorist on campus this wa supposed to be two day poster campaign to counteract the george mason university hosting an official national conference for student for justice in palestine sjp which is an anti semitic organization with well documented tie to hamas terrorist group whose stated goal is to exterminate the jew the gmu poster campaign wa conceived by the david horowitz freedom center in every communist regime or despotic hellhole throughout history one of the first group of people they go after are the artist they are considered especially dangerous that when they aren going after jew of course oleg went to gmu to hang poster and sticker against justice in palestine group that ha terrorist connection instead he wa treated like domestic terrorist himself the police knew which rental car he had and a they were putting up three poster with wheat paste the police arrested them for destroying property it totally water soluble and the poster would have washed off with the first rain instead of giving oleg and his partner citation or warning the campus police frisked them cuffed them and took them in they wanted to make an example of him here is the first part of oleg story about persecution for doing nothing more than hanging anti terrorism poster in defense of israel and jew in virginia my part in it wa to create provocative artwork for the poster and to hang them around the gmu campus a well a to distribute flyer in order to raise awareness among the student faculty and the administration about the true meaning of their support for the sjp conference on the first day my friend and placed few sticker on wall pole and sign around the gmu campus we also placed paper flyer inside and outside the university building we had decided to hang the larger poster on the following night right before the start of the sjp conference arriving at the campus in the evening we noticed large police presence everywhere including the campus starbucks from what we overheard at the table the police were on the lookout for people posting disturbing flyer at one point we considered canceling our mission due to this higher risk but then decided to hang few poster in new location in order to get the message out more effectively we only had time to hang three large poster when at about 4am our car wa pulled over by gmu pd cruiser with flashing light a we found out later they already had description of our rental kia optimum officer j guston and his female partner officer daniel requested to see our driver license which they took away then they inquired if we had any weapon and proceeded with the visual search noticing our bucket with mixed wheat paste and some rolled poster on the back seat covered with towel the police officer took picture of the content of our car and retrieved some of the loose flier from the floor a evidence they claimed that since we were covering the poster and flyer with towel we intended to conceal our wrongdoing we explained that the towel were needed to wipe our hand to prevent the bucket from spilling and to stop the paper from rolling around the car which wa the honest truth the officer said we had been photographed while attaching the flyer but never showed u the actual picture they ordered u to give them our car key and to step out of the car then we were told to put our hand behind our back and to spread our leg officer guston then held my thumb behind my back with his left hand while his right hand gave me complete and very thorough pat down and searched the content of my pocket he repeated the same procedure with my friend repeatedly asking u if we had any kind of weapon on u or in the car my friend and tried to be a friendly and cooperative a the situation allowed but that had no effect we were ordered to sit on the curb a officer daniel told u that the content of our poster wa violent and disturbing to some student especially the one with the hamas terrorist standing in pool of blood over his dead victim such interpretation flipped our message on it head entirely turning it from sympathy for the victim of violence into threat of violence it dawned on me that the reason they kept searching u and asking about weapon wa that they were convinced we were member of some violent militant group of domestic terrorist who meant to do harm to the student stereotype largely created by the progressive medium and unscrupulous politician and now we defenseless artist armed with nothing but brush and paper became victim of this manipulative mythology which caused the police to treat u with extreme prejudice at the same time the officer who handled u a if we were terrorist seemed to be blissfully unaware of the true nature of the sjp they were defending and their organization very real tie to known terrorist organization with record of mass murder kidnapping and targeting innocent civilian since they couldn find any weapon and our message wa protected by the first amendment the officer decided to charge u with destruction of property worth of at least 2 500 which wa class 6 felony editor note according to va law intentional destruction of property that is worth 1 000 or more is class 6 felony punishable by up to 5 year in prison and maximum of 2 500 in fine they claimed we had super glued our flier to school sign and it wa impossible to peel them off it didn matter that we never used permanent glue or that there could be other volunteer on campus who posted the sticker they could have downloaded online our wallpaper paste wa made of wheat and water we only used it on three large poster which could be easily removed with water and would be washed off by the first rain the rest were sticker printed on regular self adhesive paper found in any office store they too could be easily removed with tissue soaked in goo gone common household cleaner found in any dollar store we even offered to remove any poster and sticker for them then catch our flight in the morning and never bother them again but the officer weren interested in that they seemed to have rather inflexible phantom image of u a dangerous felon and right wing extremist who belonged in jail phone call that officer guston made inside his cruiser seemed to reinforce their determination stepping out into the street he ordered u to put our hand behind our back and then handcuffed u so tightly that our bruise were painful to the touch even on the following day then he emptied our pocket took away my hat and placed everything in two plastic bag we were then taken to the back of his police car officer guston never read u our right he simply declared that we were under arrest for committing felony and were going to jail the partitioned space in the back of his police cruiser wa extremely narrow which forced my friend and to contort our body in order to avoid additional pain from leaning on our tightly handcuffed hand behind our back the full account can be found at american thinker please go there and read it all it wa oleg this time but it could be any of u next the arresting officer told them they could never come to gmu again what happened to free speech and your constitutional right these charge should not stick they were not read their right and therefore the charge should be dismissed but with the progressive court and judge we have now who know what will happen oleg quoted george orwell if you want vision of the future imagine boot stamping on human face forever he add that is what the future of america also will look like if progressivism and political correctness continue to expand their grip on every sphere of life oleg survived the soviet union and persecution there he ll survive this but it is just disgraceful that in the land of the free that someone would be treated this way for exercising free speech just shameful and it figure it is in terry mcauliffe state

august 2015 and continued over the course of many month the b notified the committee of the original hacking but reached tech support contractor and went back and forth with him for month before the leadership of the organization wa informed and took step to halt the intrusion the committee and the bureau have blamed each other for the delay and the pattern continued on friday according to multiple democrat in the meeting afterward representative adam schiff democrat of california called the tenor of the exchange contentious at time don want to go into the content of what were discussed mr schiff said but great many member are concerned with whether the director ha employed double standard the hearing took place day after the justice department inspector general said it wa investigating mr comey decision during the campaign to hold news conference announcing the end of the case and then just before the election inform congress there wa possible new evidence only to say day later that it did not amount to anything mr comey didn really answer said representative jerrold nadler of new york he dismissively referred to mr comey a policeman and added don remember anything substantive he said the reaction to the assessment by intelligence agency that russia sought to promote the candidacy of donald trump ha been mixed mr trump ha seen it a undermining his electoral victory and ridiculed the agency accusing them this week of using leak to discredit him after it briefed him on dossier of unsubstantiated report of compromising personal information the russian allegedly collected but on friday senator richard burr of north carolina the chairman of the intelligence committee and the panel vice chairman senator mark warner democrat of virginia announced that the committee would hold hearing on the russian activity and it effect on the election before russian were an issue there wa the b investigation into whether mr clinton or her aide mishandled classified information that wa in email on private server she wa using mr comey discussed the investigation and sharply criticized mr clinton at news conference announcing that no charge would be brought against her he also wrote two letter near the end of the campaign that clinton supporter say cost her the election but mr comey ha not publicly commented on whether there are any open investigation of mr trump or anyone associated with his campaign democrat said the closest mr comey came on friday to offering an explanation for his action wa to say he would only disclose an ongoing investigation if the public had an overwhelming need to know about it or if it wa obvious there wa one underway he said he did not believe any possible investigation into trump or his associate met either standard the b s position is that it doe not discus counterintelligence investigation that could compromise important method and source speaking to reporter afterward m pelosi said that really the american people are owed the truth there is great deal of evidence to say that this is an issue of high interest to the american people she continued for that reason the b should let u know whether they re doing that investigation or not they re usually inscrutable the b declined to comment on the meeting mr nadler said he thought mr comey should have been fired month ago other democrat perhaps concerned about who mr trump would name to replace mr comey either said that he should remain on the job or that they were still unsure the meeting in the auditorium of the capitol visitor center wa standing room only some republican unsurprisingly had different reaction their question and comment seemed to make the case that hillary clinton would be president if it were not for hacking representative steve king of iowa said mr king left the meeting unconvinced about the russian hacking which the intelligence chief did manage to discus amid the question about mr comey conduct the congressman added that he thought some intelligence official were trustworthy but not all people there need to be rooted out he said without elaborating',\n",

              " 'after learning he had early stage prostate cancer paul kolnik knew he wanted that cancer destroyed immediately and with a little disruption a possible to his busy life a the new york city ballet photographer so mr kolnik 65 chose type of radiation treatment that is raising some eyebrow in the prostate cancer field it is more intense than standard radiation and take much le time five session over two week instead of 40 session over about two month or 28 session over five to six week the newer therapy is surging in popularity but no one know whether it is a effective in curing prostate cancer or how it side effect compare the rise of radiation is an example of the evidentiary blind spot that bedevil the treatment of prostate cancer it is second only to lung cancer in men striking 180 000 patient year but treatment for lung cancer and for other common cancer like those of the breast and colon have been evaluated in randomized clinical trial more often than those for prostate cancer the number of men getting the short intense treatment called stereotactic body radiation therapy or b t more than doubled to 1 886 in 2013 from 716 in 2007 according to the most recent medicare data the number of men getting standard radiation therapy fell over that same time period according to medicare to 47 512 from 66 549 the national cancer institute ha just agreed to fund clinical trial that researcher hope will settle which treatment is better it will randomly assign 538 men to have either short course of five intense radiation session over two week or 28 treatment over five and half week comparing outcome for quality of life a well a survival but it will be at least eight year before the answer are in in the meantime men and their doctor are left with uncertainty ideally we want to show five treatment is better said dr rodney elli radiation oncologist at case comprehensive cancer center in cleveland and the principal investigator for the trial one reason for the dearth of data is that prostate cancer usually grows slowly if at all so it can take many year to see if treatment saved life it is expensive and difficult to follow patient for such long time and the treatment given to the men often change over decade making doctor wonder if the result are relevant also researcher who have tried to conduct study comparing treatment often failed because specialist were already convinced that the method they used wa best and were reluctant to assign men to other treatment dr ian thompson of the university of texas health science center in san antonio said he wa involved with several clinical trial that withered for that reason when clinical trial succeed though they can provide important information for example recent one showed that drug can prolong life for men whose prostate cancer recurs after surgery to remove the prostate the researcher on the new study think recruitment will not be major problem because they are comparing different course of radiation rather than entirely different approach for example surgical removal of the prostate versus implantation of radioactive seed in the prostate study to investigate those two approach closed because investigator were able to enroll only 20 patient dr thompson said for men quality of life is often pivotal in choosing treatment weighing which possible side effect sound worse with surgery urinary incontinence and impotence or with radiation bowel problem including diarrhea and rectal leakage and impotence with the shorter radiation treatment there is also possibility that scarring can block the urethra an effect that might not emerge until year after the treatment in the absence of broad base of solid evidence men often make decision based on personal preference or on the advice of trusted doctor like mr kolnik some want a short recuperation a possible and find the newer kind of radiation treatment appealing but prostate cancer specialist worry about the lack of data dr james yu radiation oncologist at yale who will lead the quality of life assessment for the new clinical trial say crucial unanswered question are how fast can you give it and how fast is too fast very high dose radiation wa studied in the treatment of lung cancer said dr anthony d amico radiation oncologist at brigham and woman hospital and the dana farber cancer institute in boston for lung cancer patient with small tumor that are not near sensitive structure like large blood vessel it appears to be just a curative a surgery but lung cancer is easier to treat because with properly selected patient doctor can avoid sensitive tissue all the oncologist ha to worry about is hitting the cancer not so with prostate cancer the urethra is within the prostate and the bladder neck is literally touching to top of the prostate dr amico said also the rectum is directly behind the prostate radiation can damage those other tissue he said injury to the urethra and bladder neck might not show up until five or 10 year after the treatment dr amico noted those structure can scar and close limiting the flow of urine it also can take year before rectal scarring produce symptom like bleeding few year ago dr yu and his colleague looked at medicare data and reported that men who had more intense radiation therapy were more likely to have urinary problem after two year than those who had the therapy dr yu noted that his study wa not randomized trial the gold standard but he said the result were not reassuring now though he is not so sure the intense therapy is worse in my own experience these men have done really well he said that tell u that technique improved or the medical claim we evaluated were not indicative of major toxicity or the way we and others at center deliver radiotherapy is different the lack of solid data bother dr daniel lin chief of urologic oncology at the university of washington when men ask him about the shorter radiation course he tell them it probably can work but it doesn have result and it hasn been tested against standard radiation at center like sloan kettering doctor are relying on their own experience dr michael zelefsky radiation oncologist who treated mr kolnik there said that several year ago 90 percent of his patient had the standard course of treatment now 90 percent choose the shorter course on the basis of sloan kettering experience with several hundred men who had the intense radiation therapy over the past three year the treatment he said is emerging a very exciting form of therapy mr kolnik is more than satisfied during his treatment he said totally kept up with my schedule he did not even tell anyone other than few close friend that he wa having radiation therapy the treatment begin and it finish before you even realize it mr kolnik said',\n",

slightly alkaline or neutral ph inner terrain is able to fend them off and keep them from colonizing into tumorous mass on the other hand those who indulge primarily in the sad standard american diet which includes lot of factory farmed meat and junk food saturated with refined sugar or high fructose corn syrup hfc which processed food use even with their non sweet product to keep you addicted along with all those refined carbs in refined grain baked product are adding fuel literally to the fire of cancer mainstream oncology ignores this 1930s nobel prize discovery by otto warburg aka the warburg effect when normal cell begin to lack oxygen respiration to utilize glucose and nutrient metabolically for cellular energy they depend on fermenting sugar to thrive without oxygen and become cancerous yum ice cream with my chemo instead oncologist administer chemo iv therapy while giving their patient ice cream and cooky a the poison is injected into them big profit from the treatment and selling those toxic drug at profit also cancer cell consume sugar about 19x faster than healthy cell dr murray susser md mainstream medicine refuse to look into diet a function of potential metabolic dysfunction that help promote and maintain cancer while asserting genetic disposition a primary cause of cancer their hubris and incredible profit thrive from toxic intervention such a chemotherapy and radiation the first concern with preventing or eliminating cancer should be what you put into your body that give you control over cancer it a no brainer when it come to avoiding soda juice with added sugar pastry candy and processed food that use processed grain and even add sugar or hfc to food that are not even sweet that to keep you addicted even if you can taste it refined sugar is actually addictive some claim it even a addictive a cocaine recent study that make sugar carcinogenic but now it even worse green med info ha uncovered study that seems to be hidden from the public eye and is certainly not welcome within our orthodox oncology system it would cramp the food and soda business profit if refined sugar is seen a carcinogenic the study increased sugar uptake promotes oncogenesis via epac rap1 and glcnac pathway wa published in the 2013 2014 journal of clinical investigation jci because it is free access journal you can access the full text not just the abstract here wonder how come this study hasn made much of stir in our sick care system since it is so accessible instead it wa dug up by research scout for green med info it is of course full of biochemical detail which is what medical people are supposed to be familiar with so for now let be content with layman summary report of their study which wa an in vitro culture petri dish and test tube study a opposed to an in vivo animal or human study this way they could really play around with and analyze the result with total control here the bottom line of this study increased glucose uptake lead to early phase of cancer cell creation while curbing glucose intake reversed cancerous cell into normal cell in other word sugar is carcinogenic a well a fodder for already existing cancer cell it important to not confuse the enormous amount of refined sugar table sugar or hfc one take in with soda and processed food with naturally occurring sugar and fructose in plant food regardless of how high the glycemic index may be fruit juice don need added sugar but many fruit juice have sugar added that the type of beverage or food that need to be avoided but table sugar is refined and most off the shelf bread and pastry are composed of refined grain that are refined carbohydrate which become sugar instantly without any compensating nutrition they are processed out of whole food to be independent of other compound that balance natural whole food to make them beneficial an interesting informative excerpt from the cancer tutor dr tony antonio jimenez hypothesizes that sugar from organic produce may not contribute to cancer cell growth like it adulterated counterpart refined sugar hfc he explains that human mammalian cell absorb levorotatory left spinning molecule while cancer

approval to take over one of the world largest supplier of seed and pesticide by clearing the deal with european union regulator china national chemical corporation is close to the 43 billion takeover of syngenta the swiss farm chemical and seed company it would be the largest chinese takeover of foreign company and is one of three proposed merger in international race seeking greater influence over the world food supply china ha been trying to develop it own seed industry and agricultural chemical a well for decade and the progress ha been slow said fred gale senior economist at the united state department of agriculture this is an attempt to upgrade productivity the deal between china national chemical corporation company known a chemchina and syngenta come a trade relation between china and the west have become increasingly tense the situation ha been made worse by president trump sharp talk on the issue president trump host the chinese president xi jinping at his resort in florida on thursday and trade is certain to be on the agenda already mr trump ha said that largely because of trade issue the meeting would be very difficult one syngenta clearance from the european union is part of an international competition that includes dow chemical and dupont who are still working to close their merger though best known a chemical company dow and dupont both based in the united state also have huge agricultural business bayer ag the german industrial conglomerate is also trying to complete it multibillion takeover of monsanto that deal would give bayer control of the company most closely associated with the rise of genetically modified food and chemchina takeover of syngenta would give beijing more influence over many of the seed and chemical it need to feed it swelling population if all three deal are completed they would reshape the global agricultural chemical business reducing competition in the industry it is an important play for china which ha struggled to maintain and upgrade it food supply in recent year china hope to better feed it increasingly affluent population but several food scandal have made chinese citizen suspicious of domestic supply chain those scandal have fueled anxiety about genetically modified food even a china want to use the science to increase production although china ha poured money into research it still ban cultivation of genetically modified food for human consumption and knowledge about genetically modified organism is limited the chemchina deal could bolster china effort to become major player in genetically modified food but mr gale said chinese consumer would probably remain wary the general public ha become very suspicious of seed he said that will be an obstacle to syngenta becoming pipeline for m seed in the china market chemchina will have to sell prized asset to take control of syngenta to appease european official it must sell substantial part of it european business that make pesticide and substance that stimulate or slow plant growth it is important for european farmer and ultimately consumer that there will be effective competition in pesticide market also after chemchina acquisition of syngenta margrethe vestager the european union commissioner in charge of competition policy said in statement chemchina ha offered significant remedy which fully address our competition concern the european union granted it approval day after chemchina received the from the united state federal trade commission the t s approval hinged on chemchina selling part of subsidiary business in the united state to an agricultural chemical company based in california the committee on foreign investment in the united state which focus on national security issue and wa also regarded a significant potential obstacle cleared the deal in august the chemchina deal for syngenta is part of spate of consolidation in the agricultural chemical industry globally a company have tried to meet the challenge of falling crop price their effort to win new customer are being made more difficult by consumer resistance widespread suspicion of genetically modified food in europe mean that protest against monsanto can draw thousand and several european country ban their cultivation the approval of antitrust agency would be seen a promising for others seeking deal said dale stafford the head of merger and acquisition for the america at bain company business consultancy this sends strong signal that even though there need to be concession with the right strategic deal they can happen mr stafford said the ability to complete another agricultural chemical deal however could be diminished by the huge deal that have been done a market get more concentrated the impact on competition get amplified said elai katz who lead the antitrust practice at the law firm cahill gordon reindel this could make it harder to get deal past agency or to find buyer for divestiture in recent year chinese company have been on an acquisition binge buying major strategic asset like copper mine and oil deposit and investing in flashier if le economically or geopolitically important deal for marquee name like the waldorf astoria hotel in manhattan lately there have been sign that the shopping spree might be ending china ha tightened limit on how much money it is allowing past it border and that ha threatened purchase that some chinese official have criticized a frivolous far fewer overseas acquisition by chinese company have been announced this year than by this time year ago the value of these deal ha also fallen to about 31 billion this year compared with 87 billion at the same point last year according to dealogic the financial data company american and european company alike have criticized china ambitious plan to build up it own technology industry which the overseas business worry could create global competitor and potentially weaken their business in the big chinese market and in the united state takeover watchdog have blocked several deal that they say could affect national security while some lawmaker are calling for even tighter review yet chinese company have shown willingness to be aggressive when it matter and for china food matter on one hand they want to have the best technology but at the same time they don want their market to be dominated by international company like monsanto dupont or bayer mr gale said so that the fastest way to do it buy the technology that seems to be china strategy now',\n",

that may soon have others in choosing mr ross to be the face of american business for the rest of the world donald trump is turning not to cautious corporate chieftain but to speculator like his presumptive bos mr ross ha been considered either hero or villain during his career there is not lot in between in 2002 he won praise from worker when he bought the shuttered steel mill of ltv bankrupt company in cleveland four year later mr ross wa pilloried after an explosion at the sago mine in west virginia which his company had bought few week earlier killed 12 miner the stark contrast reflect the nature of the world in which mr ross operates distressed investing he made his name scouring the landscape for business left for dead that he could sink money into and then profit from when they were resurrected it is business that requires nerve of steel and strong stomach the chance of failure along with headline about collapsed business and lost job are balanced against the opportunity for big reward if turnaround strategy work some business where he ha invested like textile mill have struggled but other investment have salvaged industry and job while providing lucrative payday his bet wa in the steel industry more than decade ago time when few wanted anything to do with it mr ross cobbled together the ailing asset of ltv and bethlehem steel into new company called international steel group which wa sold in 2004 to mittal steel for 4 5 billion there were no outsider who were willing to step forward and make an investment said ron bloom an investment banker who negotiated with mr ross for the united steelworker he went where angel feared to tread like his investing the politics of mr ross former democrat do not always stick to orthodox point of view mr ross ha expressed strong conservative belief on some issue favoring big tax cut for business for example and repeal of president obama health law yet mr ross ha also suggested that he is receptive to some of the view favored by american labor union and by mr trump the president ha huge amount of fire in term of abrogating treaty and he can do lot without reference to congress mr ross said in an interview the day after the election mr ross member of mr trump economic team during the campaign said he expected the new president to do lot on trade and regulation through executive action he is serious about suspending any new regulation said mr ross who held one of mr trump first spokesman for mr trump jason miller said though trump ha not yet announced his pick for this position it go without saying that mr ross ha been fantastic advocate for the plan to bring back job eliminate the trade deficit and make good deal for america worker the nomination of mr ross would be the capstone to career on wall street that ha spanned decade and ha made him one of the most visible and successful of breed of investor known a vulture because of their penchant for going after nearly dead business mr ross by contrast ha often preferred to see himself a another kind of bird the mythical phoenix helping business rise from the ash to some degree mr ross helped mr trump do that when some of his casino in atlantic city fell on hard time mr ross and carl icahn another billionaire investor and supporter of mr trump were both bondholder in the trump taj mahal casino when it wa teetering on financial collapse in 1990 instead of pushing the casino into an immediate bankruptcy mr ross and mr icahn worked with mr trump and others to structure more orderly bankruptcy filing in 1991 the negotiated restructuring helped mr trump salvage his name and brand at time when he arguably did not have many friend on wall street the low point of mr ross career wa the deadly mine disaster in west

wa named to mr trump economic team during the campaign some suggest mr ross business tie may pose potential conflict of interest but the sale of his company l ross may make it easier for mr ross to separate himself from it interest which include business in europe china and india his remaining financial interest in the firm fund could be put in blind trust and he could easily resign from the five corporate board on which he sits still those overseas deal could raise question about his relationship with foreign leader and businesspeople from china and russia he is vice chairman of the bank of cyprus the biggest bank in that european island nation and he is credited with helping the bank to recover from severe crisis in 2013 but mr ross investment in the bank also make him de facto

electoral battleground of arizona and ohio are to begin voting on oct 12 nearly four week before election day and north carolina and florida will be underway before halloween early voting ha become critical even decisive factor in presidential election president obama wa sufficiently ahead in the early vote in iowa and nevada in 2012 that his campaign shifted resource from those state to others according to former adviser who also credited enthusiastic early voting in 2008 for his victory in north carolina and elsewhere nearly 32 percent of voter cast their ballot before election day in 2012 according to census data compared with 29 7 percent in 2008 and 20 percent in 2004 with mr clinton spending aggressively to try to dominate the early vote mr trump who ha repeatedly created distraction for himself in the past two week is in jeopardy not just of being outmaneuvered but also of running out of chance to improve perception of him enough to win over undecided voter when you have something a catastrophic a the trump campaign is becoming there aren enough week left to turn thing around and little ability to organize effectively and capture strong share of the early vote said mike murphy veteran republican strategist who worked on behalf of jeb bush during the primary if mr clinton swamp mr trump in the early vote in some swing state she can move staff and money to the most competitive place like florida north carolina and ohio judging from recent poll while he scramble to battle on multiple front a many a 40 percent of voter cast ballot in the early state and you can organize overnight or even in just few week and win them said neil newhouse who wa mitt romney pollster in 2012 truthfully if the clinton campaign inherited what the obama campaign put together they ve got to have head start in this over the trump campaign indeed mr clinton team which includes number of former top obama campaign lieutenant ha been working with county official to ensure that voter in swing state have place to cast their ballot early organizing voter at the neighborhood level and contacting those who may not know that they must request absentee ballot in jurisdiction that do not automatically send them some clinton ally are also organizing soul to the poll bus that take church member to vote immediately after sunday church service in democratic stronghold like cleveland early voter tend to be older and more partisan and many choose to cast absentee ballot by mail while others prefer to go to polling site during special evening and weekend hour in arizona many vote early rather than stand in long line in the heat on election day early voting rule and time vary widely by state and some legislature have sought to put new limit on option like sunday and evening voting attempt that have been struck down in several court ruling the clinton campaign ha voter protection team of lawyer pushing for a much early voting a possible in every state our goal is to use all available tool so more voter have their voice heard in this election whether that by mail early vote absentee or on election day said marlon marshall the clinton campaign director of state campaign and engagement we ve been working for month to reach out to voter to make casting their ballot a easy and accessible a possible mr trump is lagging far behind unlike mr clinton he ha not been running television ad which are crucial for engaging early voter and he ha state organizer of varying experience level and scattershot ground troop in most place his campaign is leaning on the republican national committee to open state office to help with early voting both mr romney and the 2008 republican nominee senator john mccain had more aggressive operation at this point paul manafort mr trump campaign chairman said he did not think early voting would put mr trump at disadvantage expressing confidence that the campaign ground operation would be well organized and executed and that mr trump would ultimately attract enough undecided voter to win mr manafort said the presidential debate would be critical for mr trump in the past strong debate performance have led to surge in early voting for the perceived winner boost that mr romney enjoyed after he wa widely seen a beating mr obama in their first debate we are organizing for this mr manafort said about early voting we have very experienced people involved he declined to provide detail he spoke before the news broke early wednesday that mr trump wa shaking up his campaign by adding two top staff member and effectively demoting mr manafort although he will keep his title after mr romney performance in that first 2012 debate republican turned out in drove to vote or cast absentee ballot mr obama recovered in the next debate and his ground force mobilized so strongly in some place that he wa able to cut back on campaigning in some key state he visited de moines on the eve of the election for nostalgia not need said david plouffe longtime obama adviser if you have an accurate model of how you are performing in early vote you have an exact picture of where the race stand mr plouffe said in 2012 he added the early vote trend in iowa and nevada meant we could spend more time and money in florida most importantly mr obama ended up winning iowa and nevada by about six percentage point and carried florida with margin he said but mr obama and mr romney also had campaign organization capable of capitalizing on strong debate performance don know if trump ha great debate or get spike in support after it said mr murphy the republican strategist but he certainly doesn have the machinery to take advantage of it by getting those people to the poll mr trump ha pointed to the usually large number of people at his rally and their evident enthusiasm a sign of strong support that will translate into energetic early voter but during the republican primary some trump admirer at his rally admitted they were not registered and had no plan to vote and trump adviser say that their voter registration effort have been relatively modest mr clinton by contrast urge people at her rally to register to vote pointing them to volunteer who have form to dispense and detail about when where and how to cast ballot hillary getting into early voting detail while trump can get past making awful sound bite said bill carrick democratic strategist and medium consultant the idea that he can fix thing and win over swing voter in the final week or two that not how election are won anymore it

60 minute science fiction show soldier have been somehow programed so that when they look at certain people they see them a freaky monster with pointed teeth and bizarre face these people look frightening and non human they are thought of a object not a people at all in reality they are themselves terrified unarmed ordinary looking people and they have tool with which to protect themselves stick with green light it doesn kill or injure the stick deprograms soldier so that when he look at someone he see them a they really are without the monstrous distortion of course deprogramed soldier is of no use to the military in men against fire the military offer deprogramed soldier two choice he can re experience on an endless loop recent reality in which he murdered helpless human being but this time experience it while seeing them a human being instead of a roach what the military call the intended victim made to appear monstrous or he can be reprogramed and get back to the untroubled work of extermination while this story is more fiction than science some reality break into the netflix drama during world war we re told accurately commander beat troop with stick to get them to shoot at enemy troop we re also routinely drugged for the same purpose during world war ii we re told also on the basis of actual study only 15 to 20 of s troop fired at opposing troop in other word 80 to 85 of the greatest hero of the greatest war ever were actually drain on the killing campaign whereas the conscientious objector featured in the new mel gibson movie or for that matter the guy who stayed home and grew vegetable contributed more to the effort killing and facing killing are extremely difficult they require the closest human reality to programing they require conditioning they require muscle memory they require thoughtless reflex the s military had so mastered this programing by the time of the war on vietnam that a many a 85 of troop actually fired at enemy though some of them also fired at their own commander the real trouble came when they didn remember these act of murder a the extermination of roach but a the reality of what they were and veteran remembered their act of murder on an endless loop with no option to be re programed out of it and they killed themselves in greater number than the vietnamese had killed them the s military ha advanced not an inch in the matter of reconciling it killer to what they have done here an account just published of what that mean for veteran and those they know and love you can easily find another such account every day

regret and neurocognitive disorder brain injury often the same individual suffers all three of these type of harm and often they are hard to distinguish from each other or to fully diagnose prior to autopsy but the one that eats your soul the one solved only by science fiction is moral injury of course science fiction only work when it overlap with nonfiction s troop conditioned to kick in door in iraq or syria and view every person inside a non human threat don use the term roach preferring hadji or camel jockey or terrorist or combatant or military aged male or muslim removing the killer

clinton in the lead are fake but in full disclosure made mistake really should have read the last 3 page because if had wouldn have published the document a legitimate leak it wa full of outrageous hollywood sci fi salvage option for the campaign that included magnetized mind control and fake alien invasion it interesting to note that all of those option actually do exist darpa experiment on thing like that and thing even creepier however it seems far fetched that the clinton campaign would could go that far and even more so that business that doe poll and analyzes them would have experimented with the tactic so removed the post there are enough lie and rumor going around the internet without me adding to them that isn the end of the story though because part of that document wa legit began to do further research and discovered that the gist of the fake document wa accurate the poll in the msm that show hillary in the lead are being faked and they re being bought and paid for we re all being manipulated by the collusion of hillary clinton the dnc and the medium their attempt at predictive programming through fake poll is so blatant that even the most oblivious people have noticed that something seems awry it ha long been successful method of propaganda to leave in just enough truth to make the lie seem viable in mein kampf adolf hitler wrote emphasis mine all this wa inspired by the principle which is quite true within itself hat in the big lie there is always certain force of credibility because the broad mass of nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper stratum of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily and thus in the primitive simplicity of their mind they more readily fall victim to the big lie than the small lie since they themselves often tell small lie in little matter but would be ashamed to resort to large scale falsehood it would never come into their head to fabricate colossal untruth and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously even though the fact which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their mind they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be some other explanation for the grossly impudent lie always leaf trace behind it even after it ha been nailed down fact which is known to all expert liar in this

winning the election he still stand by this opinion dr helmut norpoth wrote post for the hill explaining how these poll published by the msm are misleading to start with something basic opinion poll are really about opinion not action at their best they can tell u how people feel about political issue and personality do voter for instance like or dislike candidate such a hillary clinton and donald trump yet having an opinion and acting on it are two different thing barely 6 in 10 voting age american citizen turn out for presidential election ascertaining the opinion of 100 citizen is just start now you have to determine which 60 of them actually take the time to mark ballot they are the likely voter they are the only one that count but to find them is no easy chore it is ingrained in all of u that voting is civic duty so nearly all of u say oh yes ll vote and then many will not follow through dr northrup is not alone in his claim that trump is far far ahead of hillary clinton the website govt slave reported on polling app called zip back in august despite majority of opinion poll showing the 2016 presidential election going to democrat hillary clinton smartphone app developer say his data suggests challenger donald trump will be the victor based on the stats we see he look strong say ric militi co founder of san diego based crazy raccoon maker of the zip question and answer app his app pose question and poll response based on an average of 100 000 daily user go with trump based on what we see breitbart showed evidence of reuters back rigging the poll in georgia to indicate clinton victory speaking exclusively to breitbart news political polling pioneer pat caddell said the reuters news service wa guilty of an unprecedented act of professional malpractice this come a close a have ever seen to cooking the result said the legendary pollster and political consultant suppose you can get away with it in polling because there are no law but if this wa accounting they would put them in jail the look to me are far a can indicate they have merely decided to go back and revise their number in formula that remove voter or allocates them am not sure how they are doing this proportionately he said reuters ha rejiggered it method in order to get the result they want said the man whose out of the box interpretation of the american electorate were the brain work behind the insurgent presidential campaign of sen george mcgovern s in 1972 georgia gov james jimmy carter in 1976 president carter 1980 and sen gary hart colo in 1984 millenium report concurs about the poll rigging in view of so much fake poll data that is systematically dumped into the public domain by the msm the american people being gradually conditioned to believe that clinton is really ahead in this race with each passing week the clinton number increase by 5 or 10 which should put her with 175 of the populace by now yes there contrivance of poll number is that ridiculous 2016 election being rigged by the hour poll fraudulent clinton popularity grossly exaggerated these same fraudulent tactic were utilized during the democratic primary with much success bernie sander loss wa the direct result o so much fixing and rigging manipulating and scheming that sander himself permitted all the fraud is the biggest scandal of all particularly after he heartily endorsed comrade clinton for president such transparent betrayal of his once loyal will most assuredly push many voter over to trump but here the real conspiracy think there is clinton based conspiracy to cast doubt on everything coming out of the opposition which in turn reinforces everything coming from them first of all vet your source here how when you see an article from source you don recognize go over to alexa com and paste in the homepage address you ll see chart that show you how long the website ha been around and below that will be the global and national ranking of the site this isn conclusive of course there are legitimate new website popping up all the time but have to think that some of these more outrageous allegedly conservative website could be new website started by those who want hillary clinton to be in office these site can perpetrate all sort of wild rumor and fake document and this ha two fold effect most importantly these type of story cast doubt on the real leak that are out there what better way to discredit the massive information being provided by wikileaks than to mix in bunch of fake leak people without critical thinking skill will extrapolate from this this leak is fake so all the leak must be fake holy cow they re lying about our queen hillary secondly crazy rumor being spread through conservative and libertarian source make u all look well crazy if we are dispensing inaccurate information from questionable source then everything we say becomes subject to more doubt the gateway pundit show an actuarial review that determined trump could possibly be looking at landslide victory with all the liberal distortion and dishonesty we decided to have small team of actuarial and statistic professional take look at couple of the recent poll to get their take on the reliability of these poll they selected the recent fox poll from october 14 showing hillary up by 7 and the wsj nbc poll from october 16 showing hillary with an 11 point lead the first observation is that both poll are heavily skewed towards democrat at high level the fox poll consists of 43 dems to 36 rep to 21 other while the nbc poll show 44 dems to 37 rep to 19 other by selecting more dems the poll are designed to provide dem result our expert next analyzed the data and calculated result using the same data from the two survey on split of 40 dems 40 rep and 20 other the result show that using either set of data trump come out ahead with larger margin of victory using the fox data clearly the poll using data that is heavily weighted towards democrat voter is incorrectly skewed it is difficult to determine what the independent voter will do but many independent voter partook in the primary to vote for trump therefore it is more likely that independent voter vote for trump a well if more democratic voter vote for trump than republican vote for hillary and more independent vote for trump than hillary both scenario which are highly likely then the result of the general election will likely be trump landslide it easy to see how this support the possibility of stolen election remember during the debate when donald trump refused to say that he would accept the outcome of the election if it wasn in his favor not only ha camp clinton been caught more than once rigging the election they re redoubling their effort in social perception here are few way they re doing it the discrediting of website who are open about their dislike of hillary clinton the fake poll that assure everyone that clinton victory is guaranteed the manipulation of public opinion through false reporting in the msm potentially putting up website with fake conservative name in order to spread misinformation in the hope that other
